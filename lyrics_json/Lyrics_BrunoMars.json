    "plain": "As the dust started to settle from his monstrous comeback, Bruno Mars returns for more heat with fellow chart topper, Cardi B. The Bronx rapper drops bars woven between Bruno\u2019s crooning over a 90\u2019s style beat. The original track was released on Bruno\u2019s 2016 album 24K Magic, which spawned three Hot 100 singles. With his throwback star power and Cardi\u2019s fire bars, the track is destined for success as well.\n\nOn Instagram, Bruno revealed how \u201cthe one and only\u201d Cardi\u2019s verse came to be and gave her some advice:\n\nI met Cardi B at 3 am after my show in LA backstage where we recorded her verse for Finesse. She walked in the room and she was everything I\u2019d hope she\u2019d be. Never change cardi! Don\u2019t let this crazy music business change who you are. You posses something that can\u2019t be taught. You\u2019re a true star. Thank you for putting your energy and love all over this record and video.\n\nCardi has recently collaborated with many artists, accumulating millions of streams and breaking records along the way, so it\u2019s likely that this remix will be another addition to her successes. She went to Instagram to convey her gratitude.\n\nThe song debuted in the #35 spot and then jumped up to #3 the following week on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart.\n\nThey performed during the 60th Grammy Awards on January 28th, 2018, mashed up with a verse of Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBartier Cardi.\u201d"

       "plain": "As the dust started to settle from his monstrous comeback, Bruno Mars returns for more heat with fellow chart topper, Cardi B. The Bronx rapper drops bars woven between Bruno\u2019s crooning over a 90\u2019s style beat. The original track was released on Bruno\u2019s 2016 album 24K Magic, which spawned three Hot 100 singles. With his throwback star power and Cardi\u2019s fire bars, the track is destined for success as well.\n\nOn Instagram, Bruno revealed how \u201cthe one and only\u201d Cardi\u2019s verse came to be and gave her some advice:\n\nI met Cardi B at 3 am after my show in LA backstage where we recorded her verse for Finesse. She walked in the room and she was everything I\u2019d hope she\u2019d be. Never change cardi! Don\u2019t let this crazy music business change who you are. You posses something that can\u2019t be taught. You\u2019re a true star. Thank you for putting your energy and love all over this record and video.\n\nCardi has recently collaborated with many artists, accumulating millions of streams and breaking records along the way, so it\u2019s likely that this remix will be another addition to her successes. She went to Instagram to convey her gratitude.\n\nThe song debuted in the #35 spot and then jumped up to #3 the following week on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart.\n\nThey performed during the 60th Grammy Awards on January 28th, 2018, mashed up with a verse of Cardi B\u2019s \u201cBartier Cardi.\u201d"

    "plain": "\u201c24K Magic\u201d is a braggadocious party anthem described by Bruno Mars as an \u201cinvitation to the party\u201d of his third album of the same name. It combines modern-referencing lyrics (like \u201c#blessed\u201d) with 80s-style production helmed by Shampoo Press & Curl and The Stereotypes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BrunoMars/status/782882125506678784\n\nThe official video for the track dropped October 7, 2016. It\u2019s the perfect complement to the party anthem, an opulent dance-fest, with Mars joined by an incredible looking squad living it up in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nThe song won the Grammy for \u201cRecord of the Year\u201d at the 2018 Grammys held on January 28, 2018."

It combines modern-referencing lyrics (like \u201c#blessed\u201d) with 80s-style production helmed by Shampoo Press & Curl and The Stereotypes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BrunoMars/status/782882125506678784\n\nThe official video for the track dropped October 7, 2016. It\u2019s the perfect complement to the party anthem, an opulent dance-fest, with Mars joined by an incredible looking squad living it up in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nThe song won the Grammy for \u201cRecord of the Year\u201d at the 2018 Grammys held on January 28, 2018."

   "description": {
    "plain": "\u201cFinesse\u201d is the 8th song on Bruno Mars' album 24K Magic.\n\nBruno Mars first talked about the song in an interview with Rolling Stone saying that:\n\nThe next day, Mars is back in the studio to fix some of the mistakes he heard last night. First on the agenda is a song called \u201cFinesse.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just some things fucking the groove up,\u201d he says. \u201cAnytime you see us, on tour, on TV, I want to be moving \u2026 I was very conscious on this album of the bounce.\u201d\nMars opens his laptop and pulls up the latest version \u2013 the 20th or so, he guesses. He threw out one where he sang about gold chains and cognac over a silky beat (too corny), and another for sounding too much \u201clike a Seventies cop show \u2013 like I should be on roller skates.\u201d This version he\u2019s finally happy with; he just needs to fix the bridge. There\u2019s something bugging him about the harmonies, or maybe the chord progression. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s not hitting home. There\u2019s just something weird that I ain\u2019t fucking with yet.\u201d He jabs at his Korg keyboard in frustration. \u201cI just have to open it up.\u201d\n\nThe opening drum pattern of \u201cFinesse\u201d takes direct inspiration from the intro to Bell Biv Devoe\u2019s 1990 new jack swing classic \u201cPoison.\u201d\n\nA remix of this song was released On January 4th 2018, featuring Cardi B."

First on the agenda is a song called \u201cFinesse.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s just some things fucking the groove up,\u201d he says. \u201cAnytime you see us, on tour, on TV, I want to be moving \u2026 I was very conscious on this album of the bounce.\u201d\nMars opens his laptop and pulls up the latest version \u2013 the 20th or so, he guesses. He threw out one where he sang about gold chains and cognac over a silky beat (too corny), and another for sounding too much \u201clike a Seventies cop show \u2013 like I should be on roller skates.\u201d This version he\u2019s finally happy with; he just needs to fix the bridge. There\u2019s something bugging him about the harmonies, or maybe the chord progression. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s not hitting home. There\u2019s just something weird that I ain\u2019t fucking with yet.\u201d He jabs at his Korg keyboard in frustration. \u201cI just have to open it up.\u201d\n\nThe opening drum pattern of \u201cFinesse\u201d takes direct inspiration from the intro to Bell Biv Devoe\u2019s 1990 new jack swing classic \u201cPoison.\u201d\n\nA remix of this song was released On January 4th 2018, featuring Cardi B."

    "plain": "\u201cGrenade\u201d is the second single off of Bruno Mars\u2019s debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans.\n\nIn an interview with Idolator, Bruno explained the backstory of how the song was created and what it meant for him to sing the song:\n\nI was with my friend Benny Blanco (very well-known songwriter) and he was playing me some songs, and he played me this song that had a lyric like [the one in \u201cGrenade\u201d]\u2026 he said, this band is not signed, this is a CD that wasn\u2019t released. I said to Benny, I can relate to that so much, I want to take that [song] and make it my own. He was in contact with the dude, and I started writing my version, basically. It\u2019s a heartbreaking, heartbreak song, and I think everyone can relate to that. You\u2019re so in love with this woman and you don\u2019t understand, \u201c What am I doing wrong? What am I not giving to you? I\u2019ll go as far as putting as putting a bullet in my brain for you, and why can\u2019t I get that kind of love in return?\u201d"

I said to Benny, I can relate to that so much, I want to take that [song] and make it my own. He was in contact with the dude, and I started writing my version, basically. It\u2019s a heartbreaking, heartbreak song, and I think everyone can relate to that. You\u2019re so in love with this woman and you don\u2019t understand, \u201c What am I doing wrong? What am I not giving to you? I\u2019ll go as far as putting as putting a bullet in my brain for you, and why can\u2019t I get that kind of love in return?\u201d"

    "plain": "Megan Vick for Billboard explained the meaning of the song:\n\nThe song is about Bruno professing \u201chis love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams\u201d.\nMars professes his love\u2026\u201cWhen you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while/ \u2018Cause girl you\u2019re amazing, just the way you are\u201d. She concludes, \u201cMars\u2019 lyrics aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin\u201d.\n\nBruno commented on the track too during an interview with Blues And Soul Magazine\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of songs like Joe Cocker\u2019s \u2018You Are So Beautiful\u2019 and Eric Clapton\u2019s \u2018Wonderful Tonight\u2019 \u2013 songs that go straight to the point. You know, there\u2019s no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story \u2013 they just come directly from the heart. And to me \u2018Just The Way You Are\u2019 is one of those songs. There\u2019s nothing mind-blowing about it. I\u2019m just telling a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS \u2013 and, let\u2019s be honest, what woman doesn\u2019t wanna hear those lyrics?!"

She concludes, \u201cMars\u2019 lyrics aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin\u201d.\n\nBruno commented on the track too during an interview with Blues And Soul Magazine\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of songs like Joe Cocker\u2019s \u2018You Are So Beautiful\u2019 and Eric Clapton\u2019s \u2018Wonderful Tonight\u2019 \u2013 songs that go straight to the point. You know, there\u2019s no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story \u2013 they just come directly from the heart. And to me \u2018Just The Way You Are\u2019 is one of those songs. There\u2019s nothing mind-blowing about it. I\u2019m just telling a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS \u2013 and, let\u2019s be honest, what woman doesn\u2019t wanna hear those lyrics?!"

    "plain": "\u201cLocked Out of Heaven\u201d is a new wave, funk and reggae rock song about the rapturous feelings brought about by a relationship infused with positive emotion as well as good sex. Several music critics noted that the song is influenced by a number of bands, with The Police being most cited. Mars admitted that he was influenced by the band to write the song.\n\nIt received generally positive response from most music critics; his vocals were praised, being called \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201csweet,\u201d while its sound was lauded, with the song being called \u201cinteresting\u201d and a \u201cmusical evolution\u201d. The song was a commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks and the Canadian Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, while also charting inside the top-ten in 20 countries."

Several music critics noted that the song is influenced by a number of bands, with The Police being most cited. Mars admitted that he was influenced by the band to write the song.\n\nIt received generally positive response from most music critics; his vocals were praised, being called \u201csmooth\u201d and \u201csweet,\u201d while its sound was lauded, with the song being called \u201cinteresting\u201d and a \u201cmusical evolution\u201d. The song was a commercial success, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks and the Canadian Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, while also charting inside the top-ten in 20 countries."

We only had the first verse and the horns, but we knew that it was great. We then had three different bridges and we spent a lot of time trying to find out which one was the best.

    "plain": "Philip Lawrence commented on the song during an interview with American Songwriter:\n\nWhen we were coming up with that song, we had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she\u2019s in her gown and he\u2019s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them and everyone\u2019s raging. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling.\nIt was more of a racy kind of idea, as opposed to this classic marriage tune it has become.\u201c He added \"We always thought it was a good song and catchy, but we didn\u2019t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has.\nThe first time we saw one of those YouTube videos, it changed everything for us. We were almost in tears, just the power of music\u2026 the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people\u2019s lives in such an amazing way.\n\nOriginally slated as the fourth and last single from \u201cDoo-Wops And Hooligans\u201d, Marry You is a typical pop love song, where Bruno is so in love with this girl that he would even immediately marry her."

       "plain": "Philip Lawrence commented on the song during an interview with American Songwriter:\n\nWhen we were coming up with that song, we had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she\u2019s in her gown and he\u2019s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them and everyone\u2019s raging. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling.\nIt was more of a racy kind of idea, as opposed to this classic marriage tune it has become.\u201c He added \"We always thought it was a good song and catchy, but we didn\u2019t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has.\nThe first time we saw one of those YouTube videos, it changed everything for us. We were almost in tears, just the power of music\u2026 the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people\u2019s lives in such an amazing way.\n\nOriginally slated as the fourth and last single from \u201cDoo-Wops And Hooligans\u201d, Marry You is a typical pop love song, where Bruno is so in love with this girl that he would even immediately marry her."

    "plain": "\u201cPerm\u201d serves as the third song on Bruno Mars' third studio album 24K Magic. On this song, Bruno brings the old school party anthem back as he speaks to the women.\n\n\u201cPerm\u201d is a chemical that women use on their hair to make it look less rough and thick, but softer and smoother instead. Bruno wants his girl to come to the dance floor looking sexy and calm."

Bruno wants his girl to come to the dance floor looking sexy and calm."

Ain't got rhythm?\nWhat you got a man? I don't see you with him\nPut your phone down, let's get it\nForget your Instagram and your Twitter\nGot me like woah, wait a minute\nYou need to take a minute\nLoosen them shoulders up\nPour it up, let's work\n\nThrow some perm on your attitude\nGirl you gotta relax, ooh\nLet me show you what you got to do\nYou gotta lay it back\nMatter of fact? Band, show her how to lay it back!\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nAlright!\n\nCome on baby I love you\n(No you don't)\nYou never know, I might though\n(Can't say I won't, ah)\nThere's that smile I'm looking for\n(Was that so hard?)\nIf you ever need to smile again girl, take my card\n\nRazzle-dazzle, never gon' stop\nWhat you want is what I got\nYou wanna get down? You gotta get up\nDon't be stingy with your big ol' butt\nYou got a booty like\nWoah, wait a minute\nI'm just playing with you\nLoosen them shoulders up\nPour it up, let's work\n\nThrow some perm on your attitude\nGirl you gotta relax, ooh\nLet me show you what you got to do\nYou gotta lay it back\nMatter of fact? Band, show her how to lay it back!\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nAlright!\n\nAye, now you got it baby. You tryna have some fun tonight, you just gotta follow these simple instructions, you ready?\n\nYou need activate your sexy (activate your sexy)\nSilky, smooth and snap (silky, smooth and snap)\nNow lean with it (lean), throw a lil sheen in it (sheen)\nThen pat, pat, pat 'til it's flat\nOne more time\nYou need activate your sexy (activate your sexy)\nSilky, smooth and snap (silky, smooth and snap)\nNow lean with it (lean), throw a lil sheen in it (sheen)\nThen pat, pat, pat 'til it's flat\n\nI'll sing it again\nThrow some perm on your attitude\nGirl you gotta relax, ooh\nLet me show you what you got to do\nYou gotta lay it back\nMatter of fact? Band, show her how to lay it back!\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nShow her how to lay it back\nAlright!"

Playa hatin'?\nIf this is how it's gonna be\n\nI'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nSince you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)\nOh, look what you're making me do\n\nHoney pie, I'm far too fly to be on standby\nSendin' me straight to voicemail, suga, what the hell?\nOh, you ought to be ashamed, playin' these childish games\nI don't get down like that, tell me where you at, hit me back\n\nI got Alicia waitin', Aisha waitin'\nAll the eesha's waitin' on me\nSo why you contemplatin'? Playa hatin'?\nIf this is how it's gonna be\n\nI'm calling all my lovelies (calling all my lovelies)\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nSince you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me)\nOh, look what you're making me do\n\nPick up the phone, pick up the phone\n'Cause all this loving needs a home\nOh no, look at what you started, baby\nNow I'm left here broken hearted, baby\nThere's a pain in my chest I cannot explain\nI told myself I wasn't gon' cry\nBut somebody's gotta come dry these eyes 'cause\nHi, you've reached Halle Berry. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you\nDamn...\n\nI'm calling calling calling calling all my lovelies\n'Cause I can't get a hold of you\nOh, since you ain't thinking of me (since you ain't thinking of me, baby)\nLook what you're making me do\n\nPick up the phone, pick up the phone\n'Cause all this loving needs a home, oh"

Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous\nCause I got you all night\nDon't you worry about a thing, babe\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n\nClothes are not required\nFor what we got planned\nOoh, girl, you're my desire\nYour wish is my command\nTreat you like a princess\nOoh, girl, you're so delicious\nLike ice cream on a sunny day\nGonna eat you before you melt away\n\nIs that alright? Is that okay?\nGirl, no need to be nervous\nCause I got you all night\nDon't you worry about a thing, babe\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\n\nDon't it feel good, babe?\nDon't it feel good, baby?\nCause it's so brand new, babe\nIt's so brand new, baby\nDon't it feel good, babe?\nDon't it feel good, baby?\nCause it's so brand new, babe\nIt's so brand new, baby\n\nJust go with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time\nGo with it, go with it, go with it\nAnd I will go real slow with it, slow with it\nIt's our first time"

The premise of that song is that she\u2019s somewhere in Brooklyn and I\u2019m gonna find her."

The premise of that song is that she\u2019s somewhere in Brooklyn and I\u2019m gonna find her."

    "plain": "Track 9 of \u201cUnorthodox Jukebox\u201d, Money Make Her Smile is a creamy blend of rapid-fire chants, breathless percussion and propulsive electronic blips, the latter of which would make the Black Eyed Peas jealous. After spending most of the album toasting songwriting staples, Mars ventures into unexplored territory and scores.\n\nSource: http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1481466/bruno-mars-unorthodox-jukebox-track-by-track-review\n\n\n\nBruno commented the song on Rolling Stone Magazine:\n\n\nThat\u2019s the wild card. Diplo has all the sounds in his computer to make the club go wild. We actually wrote that to be a strip-club anthem.\n\nAfter a concert in Paris, we went to a strip club; the promoter got on the mic and said, \u2018We have a special guest, Bruno Mars!\u2019 \u2013 and then they played Just the Way You Are. That\u2019s the worst song to hear in that environment, so I resolved to write a good one."

After spending most of the album toasting songwriting staples, Mars ventures into unexplored territory and scores.\n\nSource: http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1481466/bruno-mars-unorthodox-jukebox-track-by-track-review\n\n\n\nBruno commented the song on Rolling Stone Magazine:\n\n\nThat\u2019s the wild card. Diplo has all the sounds in his computer to make the club go wild. We actually wrote that to be a strip-club anthem.\n\nAfter a concert in Paris, we went to a strip club; the promoter got on the mic and said, \u2018We have a special guest, Bruno Mars!\u2019 \u2013 and then they played Just the Way You Are. That\u2019s the worst song to hear in that environment, so I resolved to write a good one."

(is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)\nSay it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby\n\nJump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it\nAnything you want, just to put a smile on it\nYou deserve it baby, you deserve it all\nAnd I'm gonna give it to you\n\nGold jewelry shining so bright\nStrawberry champagne on ice\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\n\nIf you say you want a good time\nWell here I am baby, here I am baby\nTalk to me, talk to me, talk to me\nTell me what's on your mind (what's on your mind)\nIf you want it, girl come and get it\nAll this is here for you\nTell me baby, tell me, tell me baby\nWhat you tryna do\n\nGold jewelry shining so bright\nStrawberry champagne on ice\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nSex by the fire at night (Sex by the fire at night)\nSilk sheets and diamonds all white\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like"

(is it you?) Is it me? (is it me?)\nSay it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, babe\n\nJust jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it\nAnything you want, just to put a smile on it\nYou deserve it baby, you deserve it all\nAnd I'm gonna give it to you\n\nGold jewelry shining so bright\nStrawberry champagne on ice\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nThat's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nThat's what I, that's what I\nSex by the fire at night (Sex by the fire)\nSilk sheets and diamonds all white\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\n\nIf you say you want a good time\nWell here I am baby, here I am baby\nTalk to me, talk to me, talk to me\nTell me what's on your mind (What's on your mind)\nIf you want it, girl come and get it\nAll this is here for you\nTell me baby, tell me, tell me baby\nHuh, Gucci, Bruno, Guwop\nWhat you tryna do\n\nBruno, let's go\nIt's Gucci Mane and Bruno\nThat's one dynamic duo\nA lot of women want me\nBut I'm in love with you though\nYour ex is unimportant\nThat boy can't even afford it\nI drive so many foreigns\nBaby I should be deported\nBabe, I like the way you touch me\nBut love the way you f... me\nGirl, ain't no need for frontin'\n'Cause you're my type of woman\nWanna fly you out the country\nTo show you how I'm stuntin' (ya)\n'Cause you got what I'm wanting\nAnd I got all this money (It's Gucci)\n\nGold jewelry shining so bright\nStrawberry champagne on ice\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nSex by the fire at night\nSilk sheets and diamonds all white\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like\nLucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like"

No\n\nI come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you\nI always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong\nWith only you, only you, with only you\nCan I move on, can I move on, can I move on"

Reyez):\nWhen I wake up next to you girl\nIt's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds\nYou're beautiful and you're always shining\nYour happiness to me is worth more than diamonds\nMany people are there, but you're worth keeping\nThe same letters, three words and one meaning\nI love you, but we have our little arguments\nThat don't stop untill we forgot who started it\nI blank out and the thoughts around in me\nYou and I, everytime you smiled at me\nAnd I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you\nYour eyes, the world I see in you\nAnd time never goes to waste\nDon't change, cuz you can never be replaced\nThis love, you can never rearrange\nEverytime when I see your face\nRefrain (Bruno Mars):\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nVerse 2 (J. Reyez):\nJust the way you express with \"ing\" girl\nYou're nothing short of my everything\nAnd every memory so sentimental\nYour happiness is my essential\nThis a way for me to say thanks\nNo stress, I want you to give me strenght\nWhen I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect\nBut to the world you're just one person\nBut to that person you mean the world is just\nHow we ride, me and my girl, uhh\nWe do this Bonnie and Clyde shit\nWe fall together, we coincided\nThe way to my heart it was hard to find it\nBut you found dead deep down inside of this love\nYou can never rearrange\nEverytime when i see your face\nRefrain (Bruno Mars):\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nThe way you are (x2)\nGirl you're amazing, just the way you are\nWhen I see your face\nThere's not a thing that I would change\nCuz you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nAnd when you smile\nThe whole world stops and stares for a while\nCuz girl you're amazing\nJust the way you are\nYeah-ahh"

All the way\n(Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind"

Baby, what happened?\n\nWe've been through some changes\nLike we in different places\nAnd now you think that you can just do what you do\nWithout any consequences\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nAnd I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before?\nWhoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh\n\nYou use to look me in my eye but now you just look away\nIf I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay\nOh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night\nI promise, it's going to be the last time\n\nWe've been through some changes\nLike we in different places\nAnd now you think that you can just do what you do\nWithout any consequences\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nAnd I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before? whoa\n\nWhat you want me to do (do)\nI'm not gun' chase after you (you)\nTell me how can I get (get)\nBack the man I first met (met)\n\nIt's not what you say but what you don't say\nIt's not what you do but what you don't do\nIt's not where we go but where we don't go\nIt's like I don't even know you anymore\nYou're just a stranger (don't know you no more)\nA stranger and I don't recognize you no more\nYou're just a stranger, a stranger\nWhat happened to the man that you were before?"

Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nI've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go?\nWhere did she go?\nWhere did she go?\nI've been looking for her all night\nI'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl\nThat girl, that girl\nI must've seen her beauty at the bar\nUnder the strobe lights, looking like a star\n(Looking like a star, girl)\nBut everyone started rushing me\nLooking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh\nBefore then, we got separated\nShe was gone before I could say shit\nAnd I ain't looking for no replacement\nNo, whoa, whoa, whoa\nIf I gotta almost search the whole club\nTrying to get to her before she sobers up\nLet me see you throw your hands up\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nI've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nClub closing up, I'm still looking for you\nWalked up to the ladies room\nNo luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth\nNext thing I know\nShe tell my show, \"This ain't you\nLooking at you, you wanna take me home\nSo tonight, I just might put you on\"\nI'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl\nI'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl\nI'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night\nWhere did she go? Where did she go?\nWhere did she go? I've been looking for her all night"

Body is iconic\nNo way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile\nThe music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile\n\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n\nShe's a super freak\nYou wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls\nNo, she don't go where preachers preach\nShe only go to the church where dollars fall\nWatch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!\nPre Chorus (Inno Thakid)\nThen she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it\nFacial, legendary. Body is iconic\nNo way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile\nThe music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile\n\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nWatch her....\nGive her what you got, give her, give her what you got...\n(Inno Thakid)\nAs soon as I walked up in, I need some oxygen\nFirst thing I noticed is shorty's been doing squats again\nSo bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses\nWe're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering\nShe don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them\nThey pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins\nShe's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild\nThe music gets her to dance, but the money makes her smile\n\nOh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while\nYou see, music make her dance\nAnd money, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile\n(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)\nMoney, money, money make her smile"
