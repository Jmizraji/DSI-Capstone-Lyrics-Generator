He was in magcon in 2014 with Jack Gillinsky, Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Matt Espinosa, and Jack Johnson.\n\nHe officially signed with Island Records in May 2014 and released his first single \u201cLife of the Party\u201d on June 26, 2014.

    "plain": "On \u201cIn My Blood,\u201d Shawn Mendes takes a heavier and more mature approach production-wise, while still sticking to his acoustic roots in the verses. The day before the release he tweeted a message to his fans saying:\n\nThis song is the closest song to my heart that I\u2019ve ever written.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Mendes explained that the song is about his first experience with anxiety:\n\nThe concept of this song is about how it feels [when] you\u2019re about to give up, and then you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the whole payoff in the chorus section\u2026It\u2019s not about when it happens. It\u2019s kind of about something that I think everybody goes through and it\u2019s something that I think people don\u2019t talk about often, especially in music."

The day before the release he tweeted a message to his fans saying:\n\nThis song is the closest song to my heart that I\u2019ve ever written.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard, Mendes explained that the song is about his first experience with anxiety:\n\nThe concept of this song is about how it feels [when] you\u2019re about to give up, and then you don\u2019t. That\u2019s the whole payoff in the chorus section\u2026It\u2019s not about when it happens. It\u2019s kind of about something that I think everybody goes through and it\u2019s something that I think people don\u2019t talk about often, especially in music."

    "plain": "\u201cTreat You Better\u201d serves as the lead single for Shawn Mendes' second studio album. The single released on June 3, 2016. The song rocketed up the iTunes charts to number 3 within hours of release, in part, due to Shawn\u2019s #BetteroniTunes drive, encouraging fans to buy it directly from the Apple service.\n\nLyrically, Mendes sings to his romantic interest, promising to be a better boyfriend than the one she currently has. There was some speculation that this song was about Camila Cabello, the Fifth Harmony member who was rumored to have been dating Mendes in 2016. Both of them, however, insist that they\u2019re just friends.\n\nIn Seventeen, Mendes did talk about how he\u2019s matured since his last album, referencing a past relationship:\n\nI have songs about growing up, about ex-relationships\u2014ex-relationship, I should say. I haven\u2019t had relationships. A couple of songs about relationships with girls since fame.\n\nThis song\u2019s instrumentation is heavy on guitar. Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris helped pen the lyrics (they were behind two of the major hits on Mendes' previous album Handwritten). Gieger contributed to production alongside Dan Romer, a veteran in the music industry who\u2019s also worked with film, most notably scoring 2011\u2019s Beasts of the Southern Wild."

       "plain": "\u201cTreat You Better\u201d serves as the lead single for Shawn Mendes' second studio album. The single released on June 3, 2016. The song rocketed up the iTunes charts to number 3 within hours of release, in part, due to Shawn\u2019s #BetteroniTunes drive, encouraging fans to buy it directly from the Apple service.\n\nLyrically, Mendes sings to his romantic interest, promising to be a better boyfriend than the one she currently has. There was some speculation that this song was about Camila Cabello, the Fifth Harmony member who was rumored to have been dating Mendes in 2016. Both of them, however, insist that they\u2019re just friends.\n\nIn Seventeen, Mendes did talk about how he\u2019s matured since his last album, referencing a past relationship:\n\nI have songs about growing up, about ex-relationships\u2014ex-relationship, I should say. I haven\u2019t had relationships. A couple of songs about relationships with girls since fame.\n\nThis song\u2019s instrumentation is heavy on guitar. Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris helped pen the lyrics (they were behind two of the major hits on Mendes' previous album Handwritten). Gieger contributed to production alongside Dan Romer, a veteran in the music industry who\u2019s also worked with film, most notably scoring 2011\u2019s Beasts of the Southern Wild."

    "plain": "\u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You\u201d is the upbeat, The 1975-inspired track that marks the beginning of Shawn Mendes' fourth musical era after the May 2018 release of his third studio album, Shawn Mendes. The track marks his highest ranking career debut and first top 3 hit with an opening rank at #2 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100.\n\nIn an interview with SiriusXM Hits 1, Shawn summarized the track as\n\n\u2026an elevated version of what you know as Shawn Mendes Music.\n\nIn an interview with Beats 1, Shawn described \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You\u201d as a \u201cconfident pop record\u201d and went on to say that\n\nThis is the one that consistently every time I play it for myself, or for friends and family, it has just given people \u2018that\u2019 smile.\n\nShortly after the song\u2019s release, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Shawn revealed that he originally wrote the song with Dua Lipa in mind. In a later interview with New 102.7, he clarified that he\u2019d never contacted Dua about the song, and that giving her the track was just an idea he had.\n\nThe song\u2019s lyrics first appeared on Genius on April 26, 2019; the same day Shawn\u2019s manager, Andrew Gertler, teased \u201csome serious surprises\u201d on his Instagram. Shawn first teased the song\u2019s release on May 1, 2019 via his Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You\u201d and its accompanying music video were released at midnight on May 3, 2019. The song\u2019s first live performance  was May 4th on Saturday Night Live, where Shawn starred as a musical guest."

The track marks his highest ranking career debut and first top 3 hit with an opening rank at #2 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100.\n\nIn an interview with SiriusXM Hits 1, Shawn summarized the track as\n\n\u2026an elevated version of what you know as Shawn Mendes Music.\n\nIn an interview with Beats 1, Shawn described \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You\u201d as a \u201cconfident pop record\u201d and went on to say that\n\nThis is the one that consistently every time I play it for myself, or for friends and family, it has just given people \u2018that\u2019 smile.\n\nShortly after the song\u2019s release, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Shawn revealed that he originally wrote the song with Dua Lipa in mind. In a later interview with New 102.7, he clarified that he\u2019d never contacted Dua about the song, and that giving her the track was just an idea he had.\n\nThe song\u2019s lyrics first appeared on Genius on April 26, 2019; the same day Shawn\u2019s manager, Andrew Gertler, teased \u201csome serious surprises\u201d on his Instagram. Shawn first teased the song\u2019s release on May 1, 2019 via his Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have You\u201d and its accompanying music video were released at midnight on May 3, 2019. The song\u2019s first live performance  was May 4th on Saturday Night Live, where Shawn starred as a musical guest."

It serves as the third single from Shawn Mendes' second studio album Illuminate.\n\nDuring the week leading up to the release, Shawn released a snippet of the song every day, similar to the strategy he used for Illuminate\u2019s lead single \u201cTreat You Better.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMercy\u201d music video shows Shawn trying not to figuratively drown in his emotions and literally drown underwater in a sinking car."

It serves as the third single from Shawn Mendes' second studio album Illuminate.\n\nDuring the week leading up to the release, Shawn released a snippet of the song every day, similar to the strategy he used for Illuminate\u2019s lead single \u201cTreat You Better.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMercy\u201d music video shows Shawn trying not to figuratively drown in his emotions and literally drown underwater in a sinking car."

    "plain": "\u201cYouth\u201d is the third single off of Shawn Mendes' self-titled album, and his first collaboration with breakout R&B sensation Khalid. In an interview, Shawn spoke about the importance of the song and its lyrics to him:\n\nIt\u2019s the most important song on the album\u2026 I wanted to write something but it had to be about the feeling for us as a generation when [a tragedy] happens. So I wrote a song about our youth, a feeling that can\u2019t be taken away from us.\n\nThe song alludes to multiple terrorist attacks that occurred mid-2017 in the UK, particularly the explosion in Ariana Grande\u2019s concert and the attack on London Bridge. The attacks caused great suffering and loss of life and left the youth of the nation in an insecure and fearful situation. Here, Shawn stand up against this."

In an interview, Shawn spoke about the importance of the song and its lyrics to him:\n\nIt\u2019s the most important song on the album\u2026 I wanted to write something but it had to be about the feeling for us as a generation when [a tragedy] happens. So I wrote a song about our youth, a feeling that can\u2019t be taken away from us.\n\nThe song alludes to multiple terrorist attacks that occurred mid-2017 in the UK, particularly the explosion in Ariana Grande\u2019s concert and the attack on London Bridge. The attacks caused great suffering and loss of life and left the youth of the nation in an insecure and fearful situation. Here, Shawn stand up against this."

    "plain": "Co-written by Ed Sheeran, \u201cFallin' All In You\u201d is a ballad that sees Shawn describing what it\u2019s like to inadvertently fall in love with someone.\n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Shawn said this song was the first one he considered for Shawn Mendes the album. In the interview he said:\n\nHe sent me the hook. And it was with falsetto, right? This big falsetto hook. And I remember I looked at the emails and I texted back and I go \u201cHey dude I love this song I don\u2019t- I can\u2019t sing falsetto so, I\u2019m not going to be able to do it\u201d. And he goes, \u201cYeah you will. Just wait, you\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d And then you know, I tried a bunch of times and it wasn\u2019t until like four months later where I\u2019m like \u201cOh yeah, this amazing song that I can sing.\u201d"

In the interview he said:\n\nHe sent me the hook. And it was with falsetto, right? This big falsetto hook. And I remember I looked at the emails and I texted back and I go \u201cHey dude I love this song I don\u2019t- I can\u2019t sing falsetto so, I\u2019m not going to be able to do it\u201d. And he goes, \u201cYeah you will. Just wait, you\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d And then you know, I tried a bunch of times and it wasn\u2019t until like four months later where I\u2019m like \u201cOh yeah, this amazing song that I can sing.\u201d"

(Woah, oh)\n\nImagination (Woah, oh, woah, oh)\nImagination (Woah, oh)\n(Woah, oh, woah, oh, woah, oh, ooh)\n\nIn my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be\nAnd from there, who knows?\nMaybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time\nOr is that just me and my imagination?\n\nI keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true\nCan't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you"

    "plain": "In \u201cWhy\u201d, Shawn Mendes sings about an unspoken attraction between him and another girl; Both of them are attracted to each other but neither of them admits it. In the song, Shawn expresses his frustration over their silence and asks why neither of them breaks the tension and admit how they feel about each other.\n\nWritten over soft keys with a guitar in the background, the song follows a smooth pattern, reminiscent of R&B music. Shawn uses a vocoder towards the end of the song, which splits his voice into vocal chords to convey a beautiful but yet sad and vulnerable sound, which fits into the context of the song.\n\nAt the time of it\u2019s release, the song was widely speculated to be about Camila Cabello with whom Shawn Mendes has had a burgeoning friendship with since 2015. The two have collaborated on music in the past, with Camila featured on \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d. Rumors of the two dating are almost as old as their friendship itself. They both met opening for Austin Mahone at his concert in 2014 and became friends during Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 Tour in 2015. Both of them have repeatedly denied they were involved.\n\nOn December 21st, 2019 during a fan Q&A Shawn Mendes, confirmed this song was indeed written about Camila, whom he has since begun dating earlier that year. When a fan asked him Why did it took so long to tell Camila he was in love with her,\nhis response was:\n\nI wrote the song \u201cWhy\u201d. I was gonna send it to her and I was with Scott and Teddy in the studio. I was gonna send it to her but they told me to wait. I was gonna go see her in New York or something I was gonna tell her in person\u2026 \""

       "plain": "In \u201cWhy\u201d, Shawn Mendes sings about an unspoken attraction between him and another girl; Both of them are attracted to each other but neither of them admits it. In the song, Shawn expresses his frustration over their silence and asks why neither of them breaks the tension and admit how they feel about each other.\n\nWritten over soft keys with a guitar in the background, the song follows a smooth pattern, reminiscent of R&B music. Shawn uses a vocoder towards the end of the song, which splits his voice into vocal chords to convey a beautiful but yet sad and vulnerable sound, which fits into the context of the song.\n\nAt the time of it\u2019s release, the song was widely speculated to be about Camila Cabello with whom Shawn Mendes has had a burgeoning friendship with since 2015. The two have collaborated on music in the past, with Camila featured on \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d. Rumors of the two dating are almost as old as their friendship itself. They both met opening for Austin Mahone at his concert in 2014 and became friends during Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 Tour in 2015. Both of them have repeatedly denied they were involved.\n\nOn December 21st, 2019 during a fan Q&A Shawn Mendes, confirmed this song was indeed written about Camila, whom he has since begun dating earlier that year. When a fan asked him Why did it took so long to tell Camila he was in love with her,\nhis response was:\n\nI wrote the song \u201cWhy\u201d. I was gonna send it to her and I was with Scott and Teddy in the studio. I was gonna send it to her but they told me to wait. I was gonna go see her in New York or something I was gonna tell her in person\u2026 \""

    "plain": "\u201cBecause I Had You\u201d is the 9th track from Shawn Mendes' self-titled album & he said in an interview with Zane Low that it\u2019s the last song that he wrote for it. Musically, it\u2019s a ballad, with soft electric guitar notes and one of the most simple tracks he wrote.\n\nIn this song, Mendes talks about this one girl that he can\u2019t seem to get over. He thinks he won\u2019t be able to give love to anyone else because he used to have her. He keeps reminiscising to all the things they lived together."

Musically, it\u2019s a ballad, with soft electric guitar notes and one of the most simple tracks he wrote.\n\nIn this song, Mendes talks about this one girl that he can\u2019t seem to get over. He thinks he won\u2019t be able to give love to anyone else because he used to have her. He keeps reminiscising to all the things they lived together."

    "plain": "When You\u2019re Ready is the last song on Shawn\u2019s self-titled album.\n\nThis song is essentially a mellow, slightly drunk, love letter, where Shawn is promising somebody he will patiently wait until they feel ready to be together \u2013 if after ten years they fail to find someone else.\n\nIt is directed at somebody of his past, somebody familiar, somebody he knows inside out and feels a connection to he has yet to experience with anyone else.\n\nThe confessional-style of the lyrics, the recognizable Mendes acoustic elements and the longevity of his promise, makes this song an incredibly timeless end to his third studio album."

I just hate people who think they\u2019re better than other people. There\u2019s no reason to. It just bugs me, man. My least favorite trait in somebody is when you can feel them acting like they\u2019re more important than you, and I just had to write a song about it. I thought the best way to talk about it was to be like, \u2018You\u2019re not the queen of a country.\u2019"

I just hate people who think they\u2019re better than other people. There\u2019s no reason to. It just bugs me, man. My least favorite trait in somebody is when you can feel them acting like they\u2019re more important than you, and I just had to write a song about it. I thought the best way to talk about it was to be like, \u2018You\u2019re not the queen of a country.\u2019"

Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nI don\u2019t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud\nDo I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nI don\u2019t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down\n\nAnd I will walk this road ahead\nOne hundred miles on my hands\nDo I need to show you?\nGuess I gotta show you\nAnd if you don't believe me now\nI'll flip the whole world upside down\nDo I need to show you?\nGuess I gotta show you\n\nDo I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?\nDo I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out\nDo you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds\nDo I need to show you? Guess I gotta show you"

Add it up! Add it up!\nWait a minute honey, I'm add it up!\nAdd it up! Add it up! Add it up!\n(Verse 2)\nDay after day\nI get angry and I will say\nThat the day is in my sight\nWhen I'll take a bow\nAnd say goodnight\n(Bridge)\nOh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum\nTake a look now at what your boy has done\nHe's walking around like he's number one\nWent downtown and bought him a gun\nSo don't you shoot that thing at me\nDon't you shoot that thing at me\nYou know you got my sympathy\nBut don't you shoot that thing at me\n(Verse 3)\nDay after day\nI get angry and I will say\nThat the day is in my sight\nWhen I'll take a bow\nAnd say goodnight\nAdd it up! Add it up!\nWait a minute honey, I'm add it up!"

   "lyrics": "Time warp in the middle of a daydream\nCall you up \u2018cause the time is wasting\nLast drive, we got nowhere to go\nFear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle\nThink fast, move quick, don\u2019t stumble\nWe can\u2019t do this alone\n\nWhere do we go? We don\u2019t know\nFollow the wind, where it blows\nLet\u2019s make mistakes and don\u2019t look back\nIt\u2019s now or never\n\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\nWe\u2019re young livin' with no fear\nKids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears\nWe don\u2019t have this time for long\nYeah, we make big plans, spending all our change\nCaught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train\nIt\u2019s that time, and we\u2019re leaving, home\n\nWhere do we go? We don\u2019t know\nFollow the wind, where it blows\nLet\u2019s make mistakes and don\u2019t look back\nIt\u2019s now or never\n\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\n\nGo home it\u2019s over, but it\u2019s not the end\nDon\u2019t wait \u2018til you\u2019re older to begin\nKeep your composure and innocence\nWhere do we go? We don\u2019t know\nOne of those nights, we\u2019re driving around\nIn this boring ass town\nOne of those nights\n\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\n\nOne of those nights we felt invincible\nAnd every glass was full, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, dancing in the stars\nThought that the world was ours, one of those nights\n\nI wanna hold on tight to a little of this\nThe kinda night you don\u2019t wanna miss\nTime of our lives, one of those nights\nOne of those nights, where she turns the lights down\nAnd it\u2019s only us now, one of those nights"

(we would be alright)\n'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far\nI know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright\nIf you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark\nI know we'd be alright, we would be alright\n\nOh, I've been shaking\nI love it when you go crazy\nYou take all my inhibitions\n(Baby), there's nothing holding me back\nYou take me places that tear up my reputation\nSing it out! (Manipulate my decisions)\nBaby, there's nothing holding me back\n\nThere's nothing holding me back\nThere's nothing holding me back\n\nThank you so much"

   "lyrics": "Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer. He attracted a following in 2013, when he began posting song covers on the popular video sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler & Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton which led to him signing a deal with the record label.\nMendes went on to release his debut single \"Life of the Party\", which become successful in his native Canada as well as internationally. Following the release of Life of the Party, he has released both an EP and a studio album, and has headlined a successful solo tour.\nMendes was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was raised in Pickering, a suburb of the city. He is the son of Karen, a real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent (from a family from Lagos), while his mother is English. He first started posting cover videos on the popular social video app Vine in 2013 and picked up millions of views and followers in a matter of months, becoming well known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs. Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records where he eventually signed and released his first single \"Life of the Party\" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.\nPrior to his signing, Mendes toured as a member of the MagCon Tour alongside other young artists and social media sensations such as Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Jack & Jack, and more. Mendes was also on a nationwide tour with Austin Mahone as an opening act and released his debut major label EP in July, with a debut album due out later in 2014. He won the Teen Choice award in 2014 for Webstar in Music."

They want me desensitized\nI won't do it, I won't do it, mhm\n\nPain, but I won't let it turn into hate\nNo, I won't let it change me\nNever losing sight of the one I keep inside\nNow, I know it, yeah, I know it\n\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away\n\nYou can't take my youth away\n\nIt's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside\nFeeling hopeless, I need focus\nYou have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price\nDon't you lose it for this foolishness, no\nYou hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth\nTo be honest, I don't want it, no\n\nPain, but I won't let it turn into hate\nNo, I won't let it change me\n\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away\n\nYou can't take my youth away (Can't take my youth)\nYou can't take my youth away\nOh, yeah\n\nHow come certain boys in blue\nCan be so quick to shoot?\nYou gotta be the change that you want to see\nPain, but I won't let it turn into hate\nYou gotta be the heaven you want to see\nNo, I won't let it change me (Ohh)\n\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away (Youth away)\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away (Oh yeah)\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today (Oh, oh)\nYou can't take my youth away\nYou can't take my youth away\nThis soul of mine will never break\nAs long as I wake up today\nYou can't take my youth away\nYou can't take my youth away"

(Yeah, yeah)\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves? (Why, why, why)\nAnd you say \"hi\" like\nYou just met me\nWhy do we put each other through hell? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\nI know a girl, she's like a curse\nWe want each other, no one will break first\nSo many nights, trying to find someone new\nThey don't mean nothing compared to you"

What you been up to?\nIt's killing me slowly\nWhen all I wanna do Is get a second with you\nThe music's too loud, just wanna hear the sound of you singing softly\nWe can leave now, we got nothing to lose\n\nPeople everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd\nUntil we walk right out of here\n\nYou're the only reason I came to this party\nSo, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody\nEverybody's wasted on their phones\nI wanna find a place we can be alone\n'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party\nI came to this party\nI came to this party, yeah\n\n\nYou're the only reason I came to this party\nSo, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody\nEverybody's wasted on their phones\nI wanna find a place we can be alone\nYou're the only reason I come to this party\nI came to this party, yeah\nI came to this party\nI came to this party\n'Cause you're the only reason I came to this party\nI came to this party"

(shaking)\n(Falling onto my knees)\n(And now that I'm) without your kisses\nI'll be needing stitches\nI'm tripping over myself, I'm aching\nBegging you to come help\nAnd now that I'm without your kisses\nBaby, I'll be needing (stitches)\nAlright Madison Square Garden I need you guys to give me everything you have in this last song, alright?\n\nGot a feeling that I'm going under\nBut I know that I'll make it out alive\nIf I quit calling you my lover\nMove on\n\nYou watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking\nFalling onto my knees\nAnd now that I'm without your kisses\nI'll be needing stitches\nI'm tripping over myself, I'm aching\nBegging you to come help\nAnd now that I'm without your kiss- Sing!\nI'll be needing stitches\n\nJust like a moth drawn to the flame\nOh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain\nYour bitter heart, cold to the touch\nNow I'm gonna reap what I sow\nI'm left seeing red on my own\n\nGot a feeling that I'm going under\nBut I know that I'll make it out alive\nIf I quit calling you my lover\nMove on\n\nYou watch me bleed until I can't breathe, I'm shaking\nFalling onto my knees\nAnd now that I'm without your kiss- Sing!\nI'll be needing stitches\nI'm tripping over myself, I'm aching\nBegging you to come help\nAnd now that I'm without your kisses\nI'll be needing stitches\n\nNeedle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head\nNeedle and the thread, gonna wind up dead\nNeedle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head\nNeedle and the thread, (gonna wind) scream!\nNeedle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head\nNeedle and the thread, gonna wind up dead\nNeedle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head\nGet you out of my head\n\nYou watch me, no oh yeah\nAnd now that I'm without your ki- Scream!\n(I'll be needing stitches)\nI'm tripping over myself, I'm aching\nBegging you to come help\nAnd now that I'm without your kisses\nI'll be needing stitches\n\nMadison Square Garden, New York City, thank you so much, I love you! Thank you very, very much!"

(mercy on my heart) Please have mercy, mercy (on my heart)\nWould you please have mercy, no, mercy on my heart\n\nMm-mm-hm, mm-mm-hm, mm-mmm-hmm\nMm-mm-hm, mm-mm-hm, mm-mmm-hmm"

(Baby?)\nYou didn't leave your number for me\nLeft me without a warning, waitin' (Waitin')\nWhere were you in the morning, baby?\n\nHow do you, how do you just walk away?

(Walk away)\n\nAnd I thought you really felt this\nWhen we were talking about breakfast\nYou made it seem like we connected\nI guess I just didn't expect this\n\nHow could you make me believe? (Believe)\nThat there was something in between you and me, yeah\nI look around and I don't see you\n\nWhere were you in the morning, baby?

    "plain": "An unreleased/leaked song that first surfaced on leakth.is on September 4, 2020.\n\nAn 8 second snippet of this song was posted. The lyrics found on this page are all that can be identified in the short clip.\n\nIt is uncertain as to when this song was recorded, but going off of vocal maturity and the direction the music seems to be taking, it would be safe to assume that it was sometime after his world tour had come to a close.\n\nThe chances of this song being released officially in his upcoming project (SM4) are slim to none, primarily due to it having been leaked. In the past, leaked Shawn Mendes songs tend to be ones that are produced but do not make the final album cut and are not appropriate as singles."

The lyrics found on this page are all that can be identified in the short clip.\n\nIt is uncertain as to when this song was recorded, but going off of vocal maturity and the direction the music seems to be taking, it would be safe to assume that it was sometime after his world tour had come to a close.\n\nThe chances of this song being released officially in his upcoming project (SM4) are slim to none, primarily due to it having been leaked. In the past, leaked Shawn Mendes songs tend to be ones that are produced but do not make the final album cut and are not appropriate as singles."

   "lyrics": "Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?\nDid I see sirens go flying past?\nThough I don't know what tomorrow's bringing\nI've got a singular impression\nThings are moving too fast\nI'm gliding smooth as a figure skater\nI'm riding hot as a rocket blast\nI just expected it ten years later\nI've got a singular impression\nThings are moving too fast\nAnd you say oh no\nStep on the brakes\nDo whatever it takes\nBut stop this train\nSlow, slow the lights turning red\nBut I say no no\nWhatever I do\nI barrel on though\nAnd I don't complain\nNo matter what I try\nI'm flying full speed ahead\nI'm never worried to walk the wire\nI won't do anything just half assed\nBut with the stakes getting somewhat higher\nI've got a singular impression\nThings are moving too fast\nI found a woman I love\nAnd I found an agent who loves me\nThings might get bumpy but some people analyze every detail\nSome people stall when they can't see the trail\nSome people freeze out of fear that they'll fail\nBut I keep rollin' on\nSome people can't get success with their art\nSome people never feel love in their heart\nSome people can't tell the two things apart\nBut I keep rollin' on\nAnd oh, maybe I can't follow through\nBut oh, what else am I supposed to do?\nI dreamed of writing like the high and mighty\nNow I'm the subject of a bidding war\nI met my personal Aphrodite\nI'm doing things I never dreamed of before\nWe start to take the next step together\nFound an apartment on seventy-third\nThe Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter\nTwo thousand bucks without rewriting one word\nI left Columbia and I don't regret it\nI wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it\nMy heart's been stolen\nMy ego's rolling\nI just keep rollin' along...\nAnd I think\nWell, well, what else is in store?\nGot all this and more before twenty-four\nIt's hard not to be sure\nI'm spinning out of control\nOut of control\nI'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried\nI'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed\nBut I'm so happy I can't get worried\nAbout this singular impression\nI've got a singular impression things are moving too fast"

Don't let it stop there"
