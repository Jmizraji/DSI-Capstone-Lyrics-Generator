"Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back

I, I got a new girlfriend here
Feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

Honey, I love you
That's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I won't be late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out
I was not born to drown, baby come on

Forget what Father Brennan said
We were not born in sin
Leave a note on your bed
Let your mother know you're safe
And by the time she wakes
We'll have driven through the state
We'll have driven through the night, baby come on

If the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you lay yourself down and dig your grave
Or will you rail against your dying day

And when we looked outside, couldn't even see the sky
How do you pay the rent, is it your parents
Or is it hard work dear
Holding the atmosphere
I don't wanna live like that

If the sun don't shine on me today
If the subways flood and the bridges break

Jesus Christ can't save me tonight
Put on your dress, yes wear something nice
Decide on me, yea decide on us
Oh, oh, oh, Illinois, Illinois

Pack yourself a toothbrush dear
Pack yourself a favorite blouse
Take a withdrawal slip, take all of your savings out
Cause if we don't leave this town
We might never make it out Ho!
Hey!
Ho!
Hey!
Ho!

I been trying to do it right (Hey!)
I been living a lonely life (Ho!)
I been sleepin' here instead (Hey!)
I been sleepin' in my bed (Ho!)
Sleepin' in my bed (Hey! Ho! Ho!)

So show me family (Hey!)
All the blood that I will bleed (Ho!)
I don't know where I belong (Hey!)
I don't know where I went wrong (Ho!)
But I can write a song (Hey!)

(One, two, three)
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet..

Ho!
Hey! (C'mon girl)
Ho!
Hey, hey!
Ho!

I don't think you're right for him (Hey!)
Think of what it might have been if we (Ho!)
Took a bus to Chinatown (Hey!)
I'd be standin' on Canal (Ho!)
And Bowery (Hey! Ho!)
And she'd be standin' next to me (Hey!)

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart

Love, we need it now
Let's hope for some
'Cause oh, we're bleedin' out

I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you, you belong with me
You're my sweet…
Ho!
Hey!
Ho!
Hey! She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you think she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you the one you can't repair
But I still love her
I don't really care

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love is indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame you, dear
For running like you did all these years
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young, oh oh we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love When you left this town, with your windows down
And the wilderness inside
Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
'Til the road and sky align

The strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh, Angela, it's a long time coming

And your Volvo lights lit up green and white
With the cities on the signs
But you held your course to some distant war
In the corners of your mind

From the second time around
The only love I ever found
Oh Angela it's a long time coming

Home at last

Were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
With your fingers in a fist
Did you hear the notes, all those static codes
In the radio abyss?

Strangers in this town
They raise you up just to cut you down
Oh Angela it's a long time coming
Oh Angela spent your whole life running away

Home at last
Home at last

Vacancy, hotel room, lost in me, lost in you
Angela, on my knee, I belong, I believe

Home at last
Home at last
Home at last
Home at last

Home at last
(Uuu uuu uu uu uu, uuu uuu uu uu u)
(Uuu uuu uu uu uu, uuu uuu uu uu u) I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands til it's gone
The walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the lights
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothing left for you

I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough on

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin like that
Only love can dig you out of this It's not the words you say, but how you say it
I saved a picture where your hair was braided
They found your wallet in the cemetery
You told your daughter she was ordinary

You hate the name Junior
Your husband loved his computers
Your mother never was one
The eldest of seven children

If you don’t have it, then you'll never give it
And I don't blame you for the way you livin’
The little boy was born in February
You couldn't sober up to hold a baby

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry

Hold my hand now, time to
Go to bed, it's way too late

You hate the name Donna
You love to judge strangers' karma
We drove from New Jersey
The trucks always made you worry
We raised a saint daughter
You love to judge strangers' karma
You're praying for a funeral
You sang it like Hallelujah

You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah
You sang it like Hallelujah Oh, the devil's inside
You opened the door
You gave him a ride
Too young to know, too old to admit
That you couldn't see how it ends

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you

The glow of Hollywood signs
They sold you a bridge
They fed you the lines (they fed you to lions)
You always confused your servants for friends
But you couldn't see how it ends
It's all or nothing to you

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you say to my only child?
Promised your love, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon
It's all or nothing to you

What did you do to my eyes?
What did you sing to that lonely child?
Promised it all, but you lied
You better slow down, baby, soon One, two, three, four

Could it be I was the one
That you held so deep in the night?
On the back staircase
You fell to your knees with tears in your eyes

All that you suffered, all the disease
You couldn't hide it, hide it from me

All alone, scared in your room
Would you swear there's nobody home?
On the bed, laying awake
As you prayed he'd leave you alone

I'll let the darkness swallow me whole
I need to find you, need you to know

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea

And they wrote all these prescriptions
They wrote me off like a heel
Yeah, the doctors with their medicine
Left me to rock in my filth

From the destruction, out of the flame
You need a villain, give me a name

I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
I'll be your friend in the daylight again
There we will be, like an old enemy
Like the salt and the sea
Like the salt and the sea Woo, woo
Woo, woo

And if the city's skyscrapers rise over this island
Would you be glad to see Manhattan for once?
I knew the dream, it died, JMZ line, Myrtle, and Broadway
But I'd be glad to see Manhattan for once

Woah-woah, living life in the city
Woah-woah, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Woah-woah, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah (2, 3, 4)

Woo, woo
Woo, woo

And if you leave, don't leave me all alone
'Cause I'll be scared, I'll be naked, I'll get cold
And I miss my dad and Cleopatra sitting on a phone
So take me back off these streets and we'll never be apart
Together from the start
Never, never falling back alone

Living life in the city
Oh-oh, it will never be pretty, oh, oh
Oh-oh, we can plan if we make it
Woah-woah, we won't let 'em
They won't take it from me, no, oh, oh, woah

And if the sun don't shine on me today
And if the subways flood and bridges break
Will you just lay down and dig your grave?
Or will you rail against your dying day?

Da-da-da-da, da, da, da-ah-da
Da-da-da-da-ah, da, da, da
Da-da-da-da, da, da, da-ah-da
Da-da-da-da-ah, da, da, da When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
See, it takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And how we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured
Cause it’s a long road to wisdom
But it’s a short one
To being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart

So now i think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it’s not too late cause you’re so attractive
And the way you move
I won’t close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes
Aye, aye, aye
And be in my heart It's a lonely road
Full of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
And you'll be home in spring
I can wait 'til then
I heard you're on the big train

And oh, this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long

I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
When you say my name
May it never give you pain
But I don't wanna go
But it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind, my destiny

And I won't fight in vain
I'll love you just the same, oh

I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures, you're looking fine
And there was a time when I stood in line
For love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh
I let you go

And he fell apart
With his broken heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin, it does Gloria, I smell it on your breath
Gloria, booze and peppermint
Gloria, no one said enough is enough
Gloria, they found you on the floor
Gloria, my hand was tied to yours
And, Gloria, did you finally see that enough is enough?

Did you know me when I was younger then?
I could take the whole world with me
I would find myself feelin' alone
Heaven, help me now, Heaven, show the way
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Gloria, you crawled up on your cross
Gloria, you made us sit and watch
Gloria, no one said enough is enough

Heaven, help me now (Heaven, help)
Heaven, show the way (Heaven, show)
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me
Every night awake (Every night)
Every day alone (Every day)
Get me back on my own two feet
I would lie awake and pray you don't lie awake for me

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Gloria, will you just decide?
Gloria, there's easier ways to die
Gloria, have you had enough? Every night, I saw you there
In your old wicker chair
Singing, ooh
You were wrong, I was right
Didn't matter in a fight
Singing, ooh
Coffee mug, filled it up
Always knew what it was
Singing, ooh
Been on your side for years
You could never love without crying
Ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Fate has dealt me a lonely blow
I said, ooh
Tried to help, but only hurt
In the end, I made it worse
Singing, ooh
Is she dead? Is she fine?
Every day, every night
Give back my keys, give back my chair
Take back those clothes you always left on the floor
You drove me wild, drove me insane
Drank the whole bottle and forgot my name
All I ever wanted was a mother for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, I smell the alcohol
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
You blamed it all on your kids
We were young, we were innocent
You told me a lie, fuck you for that
Fuck all your pride and fuck all your prayers
And all this time, I waited like a fool, and for the first time
Finally, I can see you as the leader of the landslide
She left, she left, the writing's on the wall
Please believe me, don't answer when she calls
The only thing I know is that we're in too deep
And maybe when she's dead and gone, I'll get some sleep
Out there on my own, I was feeling so alone
Like a poltergeist in the afterlife
Fading by degrees, I was shaking in the knees
In the aftermath of this broken glass
Oh, oh, oh On the last time we met
Your love was dead
You held my hand
Bit your tongue
Shut me out
Spilled my blood
All around

Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you

All alone
You always felt
We dragged you down
Gave me hell
Made your bed
Now you sleep
On your own
Guess we'll see

Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you

I know that you tried
But you're no friend of mine
Falling apart
You played it the best
A dame in distress, ooh

Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I wrapped my neck and prayed that you'd feel the noose
I saw the restaurant table for two
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you
Yeah, I took the poison, praying you'd feel it too
You held your punches back and I left the room
Yeah, it wasn't easy to be happy for you

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah I stood alone upon the platform in vain
The Puerto Ricans
They were playing their salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots
I headed west I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don’t gamble, but if I did
I would bet on us

Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

You told me you were good at runnin' away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
They took the rest when you took a nap
Yes there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live it for yourself, you felt
You just felt it was time
And I’m glad, cause you with cats
That’s just not right

Like the Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

I've been down, I been defeated
You’re the message, I will heed it
Would you stay with me
Would you stay the night, oh

Dead Sea, you told me I was like the Dead Sea
You’ll never sink when you are with me
Oh lord, I'm so Dead Sea
Woah, I’m like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can’t you see
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea I don't own a single gun
But if I did, you'd be the one
To hold it, aim it, make all of the bad men run
But I don't own a single gun
And I don't have a sweetheart yet
But if I did I'd break my neck
To please her, make her want to stay in my arms she'd rest
But I don't have a sweetheart yet
I can't believe what I found in daddy's sock drawer, sock drawer today
It was a pistol, a Smith & Wesson, holy, holy shit
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4!
Things I knew when I was young
Some were true and some were wrong
And one day, I pray, I'll be more than my father's son
But I don't own a single gun
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la Some days are diamonds
Some days are rocks
Some doors are open
Some roads are blocked
Sundowns are golden
And they fade away
But if I never do nothing
I'll get you back someday

’Cause you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down

All around your island
There's a barricade
It keeps out the danger
It holds in the pain
Sometimes you’re happy
Sometimes you cry
Half of me is ocean
Half of me is sky

But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Yes, they do

Some things are over
Some things go on
Part of me you carry
And part of me is gone

But you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down
Baby, you got a heart so big
It could crush this town
And I can't hold out forever
Even walls fall down Jimmy Sparks went into bars and opened up his mouth
Said some things to wounded men that they could not allow
When it came to talking, he was always on the run
Everyone knew what the man had done
Oh, he'll take you for a ride
Jimmy believed in the American way
A prison guard, he worked hard and made the minimum wage
He found his freedom lockin’ men in a cage, oh
Jimmy loved Bonnie and he fathered a kid
A baby boy, but the mother had other reasons to live
She left the baby with a note on the bed, oh
It was a struggle just to cover the rent
His jail cut hours and now his little baby was sick
He needed money and he needed it quick
It was 3 AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Jim woke his son and buckled him in the car
They drove an hour from town and found a gambling hall
The waitress babysat the boy at the bar, oh no
After an hour, Jimmy doubled his cash
He took his kid and his winnings as the dealer just laughed
He said they leave, but then they always come back, that's a fact
Out on the road, they caught a stranger in the lights
His thumb was up and his son asked if the man was alright
Jim said you never give a hitcher a ride 'cause it’s us or them
It was 3 AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

20 years gone and now the boy is a man
Broke Jimmy's habits, got in mountains and mountains of debt
And now the sharks are coming back to collect, oh-oh
They stripped his jewelry and the boots off Jim's feet
They kick him out of the car and say we'll give you a week
Eight miles from home and only 18 degrees
It was 3 AM

Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?

Now Jimmy's son is trying to make his way home
His graveyard shift had ended and it was starting to snow
He sees an old man walking barefoot alone
It was 3 AM
His old man waved his hands with tears in his eyes
But Jimmy's son just sped up and remembered daddy's advice
No, you don't ever give a hitcher a ride ’cause it’s us or them
'Cause it’s me or him
It was 3 AM, 3 AM Singing to myself
Singing for the neighbours
Holdin' on for work
Holdin' on to paper
I was on the left
You were only fading
I was on my own
Starin' at the ceiling
Hold, holdin' out
Read it on a map
Never how I planned it
Holdin' on for work
Taking it for granted
I was looking up
I was being blinded
Holdin' on for work
Hopin' that I'd find it
I was looking up
Holding on to patience
Counting up the days
Days that I'd been waiting
You can take your time
I'll be on the front porch
Keepin' on the light
You can see it if you look for it
I would lie awake at night
Hopin' that one day I'd run
I had waited all my life
I was holdin'
Holding you
Holding
Waited for you
Waited for You're gonna leave, it ain't gonna break my heart, mama
I've never seen nobody quite like you

And if you ever change your tune
Oh, the world's got the best of you
You can always find me where the skies are blue

Wanted to change, turn into what you love, mama
And I woulda gave all of my best to you

So, if you ever need a fool
Who will give you a love so true
You can always find me where the skies are blue

Lay your dreams, little darlin', in a flower bed
Let that sunshine in your hair, in your hair

You're gonna bleed somebody's brand new love, mama
Who's gonna feel just like it always do

And when your fairytale is through
And you're looking for someone new
You can always find me where the skies are blue
You can always find me where the skies are blue  Held on to hope like a noose, like a rope
God and medicine take no mercy on him
Poisoned his blood, and burned out his throat
Enough is enough, he's a long way from home

Days of my youth wasted on a selfish fool
Who ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt
I flew far away, as far as I could go
Your time is running out
And I'm a long way from home

Laid up in bed, you were laid up in bed
Holding the pain like you're holding your breath
I prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone
You're right next to me
But you're a long way from home

Hospital gowns never fit like they should
We yelled at the nurse, didn't do any good
More morphine, the last words you moaned
At last I was sure
That you weren't far away from home I don't know why I just can't let it go
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Mhmmmm
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
The idea's gone but I just can't let it go
Time, give me my yesterdays
Save it for all you had in your eyes, I have gone away
Fate dealt you a tricky hand
Now you're just left alone in your mind
And I have gone away
I don't know why I just can't let it go
Memory's old but I just can't let it go
In the light, right here in the light
Right here in the -- hold me and don't you ever let this die
Right here in the light, and in the day time
Right here in the -- hold me and don't you ever let this die
In the light, and in the daytime, right here in the They all need something to hold on to
They all mean well
Pay your respects to society giving me hell

You could never feel my story
It's all you know
You could never feel my story
It's all you know

May your dreams come to reality
If all else fails
Give up, we needed the company
Let's drink to your health

You could never feel my story
It's all you know
You could never feel my story
It's all you know

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, I will not fold
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, she's in control
Of everything
Of everything and everyone

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh
I will not fold
She's in control
I will not fold
No, never
I will not fold
She's in control
I will not fold
No, never Nobody knows how to say goodbye
It seems so easy 'til you try
Then the moments passed you by
Nobody knows how to say goodbye
Nobody knows how to get back home
And we set out so long ago
Searched the heavens and the Earth below
Nobody knows how to get back home
Through the darkness to the dawn
And when I looked back you were gone
Heard your voice leading me on
Through the darkness to the dawn
Love is deep as the road is long
It moves my feet to carry on
Beats my heart when you are gone
Love is deep as the road is long
Nobody knows how the story ends
Live the day, do what you can
This is only where it begins
Nobody knows how the story ends
Nobody knows how the story ends As a kid, my hands were red
When you asked me I denied it
I've told lies that never came true
I have stolen and so have you

If we can make it through another day
With you believing in my innocence
And we can make it through another year
Cause we both need it to forget this fear

If it's all the same to you
Then it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame would you?
Would you still believe?

I don't want you to forget
Just pretend that it never happened
And it's just a little white lie
And it's just a little white lie

If it's all the same to you
Then it's just a little white lie
Then it's all the same to me
And it's just a little white lie
If I was to blame would you?
Would you still believe?
If I was a thief? Some of us love to think of life as a game
Others are born into royalty and can never behave
Some find a freedom locking men in a cage, oh no
Some priest insisted it's a test of the faith
And only holy devotion can keep the devils away
There's only so much that a man can pray, oh no

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Spare my blood
Spare my blood

I saw the footprints in the white of the snow
I counted thousands and I was just a rider alone
Eighteen degrees and eighty miles from home, oh no
We built a wall to keep the devils at bay
A distant army was marching through the night and the day
I swore an oath and with my life I would pay, oh no

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Spare my blood

Nightshade, won't you take me away?
And I can hold my breath for another day
But it was all, it was all for the throne

We were surrounded and the ending was near
All of the sudden, a ranger arrived, a savior appeared
Made it to safety, but the devil was here, oh no

Oh, my love
Nightshade, won't you take me away?
And I can hold my breath for another day
But it was all, it was all for the throne Charlie boy, don’t go to war
First born in forty four
Kennedy made him believe we could do much more
Lillian, don’t hang your head, love should make you feel good
In uniform you raised a man, who volunteered to stand

Play the bugle, play the taps
Make your mothers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky boys
Fire that volley loud

News was bad on Upland Ave
Metuchen mourn our loss
Sons rebelled, while fathers yelled
And mothers clutched the cross

Play the bugle, play the taps
Make your fathers proud
Raise your rifles to the sky boys
Fire that volley loud Lovely girl, won’t you stay
Won’t you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see

Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
These tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like Berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe

And oh my my, oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, United States
Vote for him, the candidate

Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carrots
Plaster of Paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

Oh

Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it’s the 3rd round
Oh, when Louie will go down
If he don’t, there’s hell to pay and hell to raise

And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

Catholic priest, Catholic priest in a crisis
He’s torn between romance and Jesus
Who will win the civil war
And he says I’m in love, I’m in love with a woman
Yeah, this is my confession
I’m leaving, I can’t be a priest anymore, anymore

And oh my, oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith


TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American Bandstand, electric guitars
And he’s singin' songs, singin' songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys
They know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing

All my life I was blind
I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl, won’t you stay

Oh my my, oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She’s arrived, my saving grace Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
My cell
My pretty little cell
Painted windows there for me
Painted windows so I can see
Falling in love is wonderful
Falling in love is so alone
My cell
My pretty little cell
Painted windows so I see
Painted windows are for me
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
My cell
My pretty little cell
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone
All alone, all alone, all alone, all alone Cut off all of your hair
Did you flinch, did you care
Did he look, did he stop and stare
At your brand new hair
Local boy, local news
Power lines hangin boots
Firemen in their trucks cut loose
A local boy’s shoes
Cadillac, cadillac
Businessmen dressed in slacks
I’m gonna buy one for us when i get back
A big cadillac

And you can wave to all of your friends
And I’ll never leave you again

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Romeo, Juliet
Balcony in silhouette
Makin Os with her cigarette
It’s Juliet
Flapper girl, flapper girl
Prohibition in curls
Hair of gold and a neck of pearls
It’s flapper girl

And you can wave to all of your friends
And I’ll never leave you again

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Cause if you ain’t behind my door
Then I ain’t got a home anymore

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song
I been gone but you’re still my lady and
I need you at home

Lovers come, lovers go
Lovers leave me alone
She’ll come back to me I believe submarines
Underneath deep blue sea
Saw the flags, Japanese
No one will believe me
Ran back to the town bar
And I told the people how
I had seen a submarine
And everyone laughed aloud

I did spy a periscope
Dead of night on the eastern coast
The police made them jokes
Told me I’d seen a ghost
Everyone thinks I’m a liar
No one knows the truth
If it was a bigger fire
I would be on the roof

Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay
(Let me go)
No one trusts what I say
(I don’t know)
Oh my god, no one paid (attention)
Overnight my hair turned gray
(Oh oh oh)
In the end it boils down to credibility
I had none, so I will die with the secrets of the sea
(Submarine)
(Can't find me)
Submarine
(Submarine) Well she was standing in a bar
I said, ""hello
How do you do?""
She handed me a beer with a kangaroo
She spoke of places I had never been
That she had traveled to
And we slow danced alone to faster tunes
I made her laugh, I made a pass
I showed her my half-dollar ring
She said, ""that’s pretty cool,""
But classy girls don’t kiss in bars you fool
No they don't

So later on the crowd calmed down
And I believe it was as if
Something drew me closer to her
So picture my surprise when I had
Tried to lean in for a kiss
And she just smiled and turned her head down quick
I asked her why, and she replied
It was nothing I was doing wrong
It’s just what it is
But classy girls, don’t kiss in bars like this

No classy girls don’t kiss in bars
Boys will break their backs and hearts
But it’s all right
The hardest part is through
Oh through
Oh through
Oh through
The hardest part is through It's coming through a hole in the air
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel that this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence on the dock of the bay
From the brave, the bold, the battered heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on

It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best, of the worst
It's here they've got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they've got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA

It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
That the river's going to weep
And the mountain's gonna shout ""Amen""
It's coming like the tidal flood beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious, in amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
Oh, I love the country, but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right, I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags that time cannot decay
I'm junk, but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to, to the USA
To the USA
To the USA
To the USA People say I'm no good
Write me off, oh yes they should
Fuck 'em they're just sick in the head
They're writing my history
Think somebody should've asked me
Everyone was safe in their beds
Their beds
And I said...
I won't live, won't live like them
Everyone, they're all seeing red
I don't know
If it's alright with you, but I'll be gone
A ghost will be here in my stead, my stead
And I said...
I can't live life underneath it all
Everyone is older now and gone
I will not be here forever dear
So let's just make this count a lot in here What time was it when you were only 18 years old?
You crossed the street, you crossed your legs
You came across a little cold
And it was all, it was all falling apart (Falling apart)

What time, what time was it
When you were in the eighth grade?
You brought the box up to the high school
You spiked the Gatorade
And it was all for, for a weekend
It was all, all still falling apart

I didn't say you'd be better off if you quit
Everyone left 'cause you held on longer than the rest
What made you leave? And when you did, you left for Denver
Why? What did you know that I did not?
That I did not?

Oh, is it one, or is it two, or is it three kids now?
They mark the time, they draw the lines around your eyelids now
And is it all still for the weekend?
Is it all, all still falling apart?

I didn't say you'd be better off if you quit
Everyone left 'cause you held on longer than the rest
What made you leave? And when you did, you left for Denver
Why? What did you know that I did not?
That I did not? The carbonation in my drink
The bubbles rise while my heart sinks
And all I tend to do is think of you
Was it easier to pack your bags
And book that flight to Paris
As the plane began to move that afternoon
And when all the trains have pulled away
From local stations in decay
It’s I who waits, it’s you who’s late again
And did you think of me when you made love
To him, was it the same as us
Or was it different, it must have been
And all the pretty dames
They’ll hug and kiss you all the same
And when they go, they’re gone
They’re not running late
Oh all, all the pretty dames
And the kids you hold in your arms
With promises to protect them from harm
But they grow, and they go
And you’re all alone
All the kids, all the kids that you hold
And it’s a shame that it ends this way
With nothing left to say
So just sit on your hands, while I walk away
It’s a shame, it’s a shame, it’s a shame
When my hands begin to shake
When bitterness is all I taste
And my car won’t stop
Cause I cut the brakes
I hold on to a hope in my fate
Oh oh ah ah hey hey
May you return to love one day
Well I hope and I pray
You get what you gave
Oh oh ah ah hey hey I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing dear, if you're not here with me

I'll have a blue heartache for certain
And when those blue memories starts hurtin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

And when those blue heartaches start hurtin'
I'll have a blue memory for certain
And you'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas  He whispers secrets through a thick mustache
And she listens to him
Flicks her cigarette's ash
And smoke hangs velvet curtains
And hides her lips
And she hopes to hell it's worth all her health risks

I know it was you
I know it was you

'Cause everyone requires a plan
I can give you
It's all been a sleight of hand

I know it was you
I know it was you I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no plans
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

And the church discouraged, any lust that burned in me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held out
When a man's rejected, but he can fight for your affection
And he can act like he never met you and leave low to the ground

But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you
But it's all a daydream, but it's you who's behind me
But you never recognize me, it brings me to you

And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

And there are nights I wake up, to the sound of a door shut
And I search on the floors but I find no tracks
And the nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
It's a bed and a bathroom
And a place for the end

I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I go numb- born with a weak heart
Guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's alright I know nothing's wrong . . nothing wrong

Hi yo, I got plenty of time
Hi yo, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight . . . say goodnight

Home- is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home- she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this where I'll be . . . where I'll be

Hi yo, we drift in and out
Hi yo, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head ah ooh Well, I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own

Well I found myself a place
Every smile that you waste
And every other careless look you’ve ever tossed aside
Well in my heart I know it’s true
That I can’t go on loving you
And that’s the truth it don’t feel good, but honey it feels right

Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own

Well of love I’ve had my share I’ve got plenty of people really who care
At times I might get wicked in my pride
But I smoke that mountain air honey I’ve been here, and I’ve been there
At times I might get lonely honey I don’t cry

Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own

There’s times at night when it’s cold outside, the moon don’t shine, the winds are crying
I wonder if you’re at home you might let me back inside
We can huddle up by the old stove we can kindle up some burned out coals
We can love our selves like the days are warm
Said, No no no no no

Cause I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own

Well, I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own
Said I ain’t nobody’s issue, don’t you come around babe, I don’t miss you at all
I ain’t nobody’s problem but my own An old lady crosses the street
And as she waves to me, I don't see her
And I know that one day I
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And how I miss my mother's mother
She became a stranger, but I still love her
And I hope, I hope she returns
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now the day came when we left her
We couldn't say goodbye, and I know that I was wrong
But I hope that she knows
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
And everything about you
Won't you stay away
So I can get my work done in the day, Okay
And maybe in the meantime
You and me will be fine

If you just relax
And check your eyes for cataracts
Its plain to see
That I was meant for you and you were meant for me
Darling hold me tightly
I think you and me we might be
Falling, Falling, Falling, I'm falling

In love

Drama queen
Like when you see a fire
You grab the gasoline
Now honey please calm down
Yes don't make a scene
They're asking us to leave now
And calling the police now

Yes he's a manly man
Cause you're defending me just like a punching bag
But I can take a punch
If you can take a jab

And catch me when I fall

And dress your wounds with alcohol
I'm falling, falling, falling, I'm falling

In love Loneliness, oh, won't you let me be?
Let me be and I will set you free
Don't you think if it was up to me
I would choose to be happy?
Let me go, the king's on high
He picks her out of the crowd to be by his side
She walks up, staircase in white
She holds her breath, pretends that this is right
'Cause all of this, it don't come free
And don't become a casualty
And live beneath what you were meant to be
'Cause cowards and heroes feel
The same as you and me, it's real
But some will run and others persevere
Victory is in the fight
And men with hearts will bleed tonight
And only rest, and rest is what is right Oh, I'm sailing away my own true love
I'm sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea?
From the place where I'll be landing
No, there's nothing you can send me, my own true love
There's nothing I'm wishing to be owning
Just to carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
Well I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
And if I had the stars of the darkest night
Or the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishing to be owning
And I might be gone a long old time
And it's only this I'm asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by?
To make your time more easy passing
Oh how can, how can you ask me again?
What only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailing
Saying I don't know when I'll be coming back again
It depends on how I'm feeling
Well if you, my love, must think that way
And I'm sure your mind is roaming
And I'm sure your heart is not with me
But with the country to where you're going
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
And take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather If you're down on your luck don't get down on yourself it won't do you no good
'Cause I've been there before, fought 100 wars, but I'm still fighting for you

Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise

Let's be Elvis and let's be David Byrne, let's all learn how to dance
Move your feet in time, put your hand in mine, we will waltz once again

Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, patiently
And I'll return, my Elouise

Elouise, why'd you leave
Please confess, confess to me
Sing my song, graciously
We will waltz, Elouise I see you
Standing there
In your favorite dress
I like what you wear

Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene

I give you my ring
In your shaking hands
You give me a sting
With your crazy plans

Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene
Oh Darlene  Just wake up, I shouted
There's some blood, around the -
Clean it up, it's okay
Go get help, it's okay
I'm too young and now it's
It's gone numb around me
Ambulance in driveway
Speeding up the highway

Suits were made for men, not boys
And this faith that we fake is a choice

I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
If it means goodbye
And I don't wanna see
I don't wanna be there
If it's the last time

Hold my brother's hand
And I'm his mother standing
In a sudden panic
Like a drugless addict
It's too late, the moment
When it runs you over
No one's safe, I need her
No one say it's over

Suits were made for men, not boys
So leave me alone
And this faith that we fake is a choice
So take me

I don't wanna go
And I don't wanna go
If it means goodbye
And I don't wanna go
I don't wanna see her
If it's the last time Twisty sidewalks, female taxi drivers
Dirty fingers, pink houses light up

And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking
Find out for once
Find out for once
Find out for once

Count the bikes, Strange violin
Barter price, smoking inside
Stray cat walks, broken English
Chairman's eye, living billions

And if there's just one thing
You wanted to see
I suggest you keep looking
Find out for once
Find out for once
Find out for once Pretty paper
Pretty rivers of grief
Wrap your presents
To your darling from you
Pretty pencils write I love you
Pretty papers
Pretty rivers
Oh pretty papers
Pretty rivers

By the street, busy feet, hustle back
Downtown shopping, christmas is tonight
There he sits, alone on the sidewalk
Just hopin' that you all pass him by
Should you stop, there are not too easy
You're in a hurry,  time has fly
In the distance, the ringing of laughter
But in the midst of laughter he cried

Pretty paper
Pretty rivers of grief
Wrap your presents your darling from you
Pretty pencils write I love you
Pretty papers
Pretty rivers
Pretty papers
Pretty rivers Loneliness oh won't you let me be
Let me be and I will set you free
Don't you think if it was up to me
I would choose to be happy

Let me go, say my goodbyes
There's no glory for me at the starting line
I was on my own in a search for the golden life

Oh I was leaving for the East horizon
And Joshua was on sea of diamonds
I left my home, it was not wrong for me to leave
I could not hold all of your promises to keep

And I was on my own in a broken boat, I cried
And what I'd give to know, is it me who's on your mind?
I left my love, it was not wrong for me to do
The slingshot fired it moved my words from me to you

So I'd been their Lord and Savior
They loved their trophies, but they hate the labor
The loneliest that I ever get
Is when I lose her voice inside the wind Well, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, ain't nobody's issue, don't you come around babe cause I don't miss you at all
I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Well I found myself a place
Every smile that you waste
And every other careless look you've ever tossed aside
Well in my heart I know it's true
That I can't go on loving you
And that's the truth It don't feel good, but honey it feels right
Cause, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, ain't nobody's issue, don't you come around babe cause I don't miss you at all
I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Well of love I've had my share I've got plenty of people really who care
At times I might get wicked in my pride
But I smoke that mountain air honey I've been here, and I've been there
At times I might get lonely honey I don't cry
Cause, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, ain't nobody's issue, don't you come around babe cause I don't miss you at all
I ain't nobody's problem but my own
There's times at night when it's cold outside, the moon don't shine, the winds are crying
I wonder if you're at home you might let me back inside
We can huddle up by the old stove we can kindle up some burned out coals
We can love our selves like the days are warm
But, No no no no no
Cause, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, ain't nobody's issue, don't you come around babe cause I don't miss you at all
I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Well, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, I ain't nobody's problem but my own
Said I, ain't nobody's issue, don't you come around babe cause I don't miss you at all
I ain't nobody's problem but my own Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
And I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
And I know, shinin' down like water

And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day

Yesterday, and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
And I know, it's been that way for all my time
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
And I know, it can't stop, I wonder

And I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
Comin' down on a sunny day
Yeah, comin' down on a sunny day Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Fleet of black, fleet of black limousines
These tinted machines, here comes the cavalcade
With the armored cars, armored cars like berettas
Flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe, keep me safe
And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the candidate
Blue eyed boy, united states
Vote for him, the candidate
Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carats
Plaster of paris, the floats fill up the street
And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry
Pageantry
Oh my my oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade
Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it's the 3rd round
Oh when louie will go down, if he don't there's hell to pay
And hell to raise
And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight
Catholic priest, catholic priest in a crisis
He's torn between romance and jesus, who will win the civil
War
And he says I'm in love, I'm in love with a woman
Yea this is my confession, I'm leaving I can't a priest
Anymore, anymore
And oh my my oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith
Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith
TV cameras, TV cameras and stage hands
American bandstand, electric guitars
And he's singin songs, singin songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys, they know all his words by
Heart, by heart and they all sing
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, oh oh ohoh
Oh my my oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She's arrived, my saving grace"
