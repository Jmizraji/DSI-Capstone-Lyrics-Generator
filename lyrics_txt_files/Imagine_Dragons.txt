"First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder (Thun-, thun-)

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder)
(Never give up on your dreams)
Thunder, feel the thunder (Thunder, thunder, thun-, thun-)
(Never give up, never give up)
Lightning then the thunder, thunder (Th-th-thunder)

Thunder, thunder, thun-

(Woah-oh-ohh)
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah-oh
Whoah

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
Yeah, ah

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in
Whoa

Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa-oh, whoa
I'm radioactive, radioactive Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will Heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass, find the wrong within the past knowin'
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Natural
Yeah, you're a natural I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!

I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

I'm radioactive, radioactive Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh-oh-oh
Please believe me
Please believe me There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today

There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow

Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me

Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (next to me)

Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it (Oh)


Oh, I always let you down (I always let you down)
You're shattered on the ground, (Shattered on the ground)
But still, I find you there (Yeah)
Next to me
And, oh, stupid things I do (Stupid things I do)
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me (Next to me) Do you feel the same when I'm away from you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you? (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes

Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had to just walk away (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade (Oo-ooh, oo-ooh)
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below

Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
I promise you from up above
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love

We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up (Couldn't be, couldn't be)
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

So look out down below
Look out down below
Look out down below
Walkin' the wire, wire, wire
So look out down below
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there’s nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
Maybe you're the same as me
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
They say the truth will set you free

Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

I'm burstin' like the Fourth of July
So color me and blow me away
I'm broken in the prime of my life
So embrace it and leave me to stray

I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (rise, rise up)
I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Want to see it all give me more (Rise, rise up)
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages (Rise, rise up)

(Rise, rise up)
(Rise, rise up) We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you (I don't know, ah)

Your love is always dangerous
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now

'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
I'm on top of the world, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Waiting on this for a while now
(Get up, now, get up)
Paying my dues to the dirt
(Get up, now)
I've been waiting to smile, hey
(And I know it's hard when you're falling down)
Been holding it in for a while, hey
(And it's a long way up when you hit the ground, but)
Take you with me if I can
(Get up, now, get up)
Been dreaming of this since a child
(Get up, now)
I'm on top of the world As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love

Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust


Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
Here we are, don't turn away now (Don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (This town)
From dust Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition

'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision

'Cause I've been wondering

When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine

I am the machine

'Cause I've been wondering

When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read (No time)

I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (no time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above (No time)

I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath (No time)
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry

Life isn't always what you think it’d be
Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
And I know, I know that I did you wrong
But will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you?
Somehow, somehow?

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you’ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top 'til you get too low

A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry
A son of a I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done

Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)

In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away (I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)
(I bet, I bet my life)

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

(I bet, I bet my life)
Now remember when I told you (I)
That's the last you'll see of me? (I)
Remember when I broke you down to tears? (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh, I bet, I bet my life)
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me (I)
I gave you hell through all the years (I)

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come runnin' home to you
(I bet, I bet my life)
I've told a million lies (I)
But now I tell a single truth (I)
There's you in everything I do (I)
(Woo-oooo-ooh)

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my life on you

Ehe-yee-eee
I, I bet my...
I bet my...
I bet my...
O-yeee-eeah
I bet my...
I, I bet my life
I bet my life
I bet my... Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (Oh, oh, oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh, oh, oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside (Oh, oh, oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger


I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been-oh, ooh
The way that things have been-oh, ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea-oh, ooh
The master of my sea-oh, ooh

I was broken from a young age
Takin' my sulkin' to the masses
Writin' my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singin' from heartache from the pain
Takin' my message from the veins
Speakin' my lesson from the brain
Seein' the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hold up, hold up
Last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without gain
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'm a come on too strong

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a ""shut up, sit down""

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm a midnight talker
Oh, I'm an alley walker
I'm a day late two-face
I'm a burn out quick pace

I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
At you are the opera
Always on time and in tune
And I am the color of boom

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover

Whoa, how did it come to this?
Oh, love is a polaroid, oh
Better in picture
(But) never can fill the void

Oh, love is a polaroid
Oh, love is a polaroid
(Oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh, oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Oh, love is a polaroid
(Oh-a-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-a-oh)
Love is a polaroid I'm sorry, mother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine; no, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine; no, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried, but I keep coming up short

I'm sorry, lover, I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days I try, and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery, and then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations, you are all alone!""

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
No, I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

When the day has come
That I’ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you

I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you, for you
I’m bleeding out for you

'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I’m bleeding out
I’m bleeding out for you, for you Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man

'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right

I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
You're cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair

I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you

In our darkest hour
In the dead of the night
I'll make it up to you
Your hands are mine
I'll make it up to you
Promises are nothing more
Than fleetin' thoughts
But you, you are my lifeblood

I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you Don't throw stones at me
Don't tell anybody
(Woah, woah, woah)
Trouble finds me (Woah)
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief
(Woah, woah, woah)

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

Had to lose my way
To know which road to take
(Woah, woah, woah)
Trouble found me (Woah)
All I look for was
Washed away by a wave
(Woah, woah, woah)

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots

I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me
I know it's gotta go like this, I know
Hell will always come before you grow
Trouble found me, trouble found me

I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door

First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
Oh, you'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

I'm dying to feel again
Oh, anything at all
But, oh, I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Gold

Gold One more day we'll spend together
Let your eyes look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But, my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But, my love, I won't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'll change my ways if you would stay
And all your tears that you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the Devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And, my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up

I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh

Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

All these years, I've been searching
For who I'm supposed to be
All this time I've been wasting
'Cause I was right in front of me

Oh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

Oh, I'm a hopeless crash collision
'Cause I'm a hostage to my pride
And by my own volition
I've been a saint, I've been the truth, I've been the lie

It's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no

Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

A new day, you can go
You can do anything you wanna
It's your play, swing low
Go high, anywhere you wanna
You can reach for the moon
Anywhere your dreams could take you
Go astray, fade away
Just leave it to yesterday

Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday

Just before I go
Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, ""Don't go""
You were lookin' at me wild saying, ""Just go home,"" and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black-and-white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, ""Don't go""
You were lookin' at me wild saying, ""Just go home,"" and

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out (Cool out)
So cool out (Cool out)

All the things that you detest in me
They keep you coming back for more, you see
We make each other get a bit crazy
But you will always be a part of me

Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out

So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
Cool out (Cool out, cool out)
So cool out (Cool out, cool out)
(Cool out, cool out) This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors)

Believe
I want to believe

All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me?
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors?
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors? (Mirrors, mirrors) Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words

I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you

I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

Can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
Can we get closer?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?

Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again
Come alive, come alive, come alive again

Can we start, can we start over?
Can we start over?
Can we start over
Before it's over, over?
Can we start over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we get closer?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Can we start over
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again)
Before it's over, over?
(Come alive, come alive, come alive again) Who knows how long I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning (Beckoning)
Who knows what's right? The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing
On and on
And on and on

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
(Shut it out, shut it out, shut it out)
I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
And I keep pushing
On and on and on and on

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down (Hey)
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul...

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now (Nothing left to say)
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now, oh!
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now (Nothing left to say)
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now



Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window


Timber, timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Why can't I see
What's right in front of me?

We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart It's been a long time comin’, comin'
Seeming like we all been runnin', runnin’
Feeling like the wild west, gunnin', gunnin'
Listen to our elders shunnin', shunnin'
Flipping on the news beat talkin', talkin'
All about the problems, shockin', shockin’
We put on our headphones walking, walking
We put on our headphones

Where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

All we see is faces, color, color
All the other races, other, other
Why can’t you just be my brother, brother?
We don't have to kill one another, kill one another
All around the world, we are one, we are one
All around the world, we are one

So where did we all go wrong?
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
(Love is our only hope)
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong?

'Cause we got the same blood, blood
We got the same blood, blood
Will it be enough, 'nough?
Will it be enough?
We got the same heartbeat
We're living for the same dream
We got the same bloodstream
Where did we all go wrong?
Woo

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong? Patience only gets you so far
Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard
Tossed in fury's weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me? (For me)
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there want to hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by my side for all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me? (For me)
For me

Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there want to hear me?

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me

It's just another downpour
It's just another downpour
I won't give up
I won't give up
I won't give up
I won't

It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
I don't wanna let you go, I don't wanna let you go
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me Hey, Mr. Cage Man
Let me get a fresh breath
Cherry bomb, head strong
I could fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate Man
Shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go along
Throwin' me a sharp right

It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr. Safe Man
Hustle me an okay
I could slide, take a dive
Take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Post Man
Slip me one more green note
I've been low, hit the floor
Looking just to make broke

It's not a picture perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done

I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die

Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Oh, every single time

And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop

So I said, ""Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""
Oh, ""Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""

She prays on her knees as the towers fall
To a god she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs will blow (Ooh)
She says, ""How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch?""
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day, oh, everything will be okay

But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop

So I said, ""Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""
Oh, ""Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""

I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
Only thing that's real to me is you

""Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""
Oh, ""Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye?
Can't we live that real life, real life?""

Oh, hey (Real life, hey)
Real life, real life
Oh, hey
Real life, real life
Oh, hey Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, ooh, you, ooh

I've been afraid, don't wanna fade out of my body
I've been astray, barely awake, floating above me
Covered in gray, what can I say? I've been a zombie
I'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave
You were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party
You were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army
You were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry
I'm feeling like you've been taken away

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh, oh

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)

Why did you leave? Why did you go leaving me lonely?
Didn't you know you were the home, you were the only?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Come back to me

You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh, oh

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, stuck on you
Oh, oh, oh, woah (Woah-oh, woah, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
As time goes by, as time goes by, woah
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh (Woah-oh) You know how we do

Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away!

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too? Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking up clocks
When the birds come back to eat
Oh, to eat
Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon
Oh, afternoon

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Oh, won’t you save us
What we are?
Don’t look clear
'Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh

Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Oh, for more
Out with the reason
In with the season
Taking down names
In my book of jealousy
Jealousy

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Because it's who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Oh, won't you save us
What we are?
Don’t look clear
'Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh

Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream

Dream, dream, dream, dream world
Only There's so much on my mind, I don't know where to start
It's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though I lost myself, I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star, you make my heart ascend

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star, we're flying high above

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate

When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way

Just levitate, just levitate
Just levitate, just levitate 4 AM, beside myself
And what I think of mental health
All the things that worry me
All the things you don't believe
I've been told just what to do
Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be
I think I learned in therapy

Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you
It comes back to you
All the things that you had lost
Will find their way to you
It comes back to you
It comes back to you
Looking back into the past
And I can see it through

It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you

Mocking birds and diamond rings
Oh, I have thought of greater things
All the things that fly by me
All the lives that I could lead
Maybe I was born for that
Or maybe I was first to last
You could call it cowardice
But leave me to my studied bliss

Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you
It comes back to you
All the things that you had lost
Will find their way to you
It comes back to you
It comes back to you
Looking back into the past
And I can see it through

It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

Maybe I'm destined to be distraught
Always a reason, breaking me down to my
Knees in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light, oh-oh-oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know
Do you know? Do you know?
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away


You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me
You were the one, you were the one
You were the one who helped me see
You were the one, you were the one
Oh, you gave it all to me

You were the one, you were the one
(Do you know? Do you know?)
You were the one who helped me see
(You're all I know, you're all I know)
You were the one, you were the one
(Everything comes crashing down)
Oh, you gave it all to me
(You're all I know, you're all I know)

I'm ready for the fall
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6, the names upon the list
For all the ones who gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on


Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry (Oh, oh-oh)
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world, mad world
Mad world, mad world

Mad world, mad world
Mad world, mad world I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your hair
That ruffles you up

If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

Searchin' to find myself
But all I find is you
I can hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?

If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

No matter, no matter, no matter what we're facing
It don't matter, it don't matter (It don't matter)
'Cause the reason I'm here
Is the same through all these years (Same through all these years)
I'm not changing, I'm not changing anything at all!


I'm coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night Oh, quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me, brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me, sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Oh pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt

I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know
Maybe you could save my soul
From all the things that I don't know

So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling (ooh)
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling (ooh)

You don’t have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling (ooh)
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, impatiently
Circling (ooh)

You don’t have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won’t run away this time (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for (hold your head up)
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart
Oh, Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation
Tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall

Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect
This is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears
And now they’re crowning me the Caesar

Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you
Ooh, ooh
Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your colors
Show me all

Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be

A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence
And that's not for me
And that's not for me
And that's not for me

Only in the summertime (only in summertime)
Only in the summertime (only in summertime)
Things will change with time (things will change with time)
Only in the summertime

Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be

Only in the summertime (only in summertime)
Only in the summertime (only in summertime)
Things will change with time (things will change with time)
Only in the summertime It's just another day
It's just another year
""One step at a time"", they say
""One trip, and you're back that way""
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight
""One step at a time"", they say
""One trip, and you're back that way""
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
And I'm begging you

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away

Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr. Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here

We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away

Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face around here?
I know every single face around here
Hearing the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here

We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way

With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away

Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh
Oh-woah-oh

With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away Early morning, take me over
Father, father, father
Take me to the top
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Early morning, wake me up
Father, father, father
This is not enough
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck

Early evening, settle down
Father, father, father
Who am I to blame?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Early evening, hush me over
Father, father, father
Are we just the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey!

Living the low life

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be
I love to be the underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey! Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks, but not to me
Cause Heaven knows that nothing good comes free

Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?

I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks, but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be
 + 
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me?
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down

I'll take your word, cause after all
You've never lied, oh not at all
But look at me, oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release

I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction, subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy

I get older and life fades
But you remain

Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it, then I can atone
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy
 + 
I get older and life fades
But you remain
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Forgive me
Forgive me

Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh
The master of my sea, oh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

All the words inside my
Believer
You break me down you build me up, believer
Pain
All the words inside my
Believer
You break me down you build me up, believer
Pain

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived
Ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
Till it broke open and it rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer

All the words inside my
Believer
You break me down you build me up, believer
Pain
All the words inside my
Believer
You break me down you build me up, believer
Pain If only you, you could see
The darkest place that you could be
Oh, maybe then, you'd understand
From desert heat to cobbled streets
From broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

If I could live a thousand times
If I could make a thousand tries
Oh, maybe then, I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know
That everyone just wants a show
No, we don't want to see the truth

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?
When the stars look down on me
What do they see?

So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

Thief Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, th-th-thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder
Thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder

Broke down on a lonely highway
So loud, all the screams in my brain
Oh how I believed in my pain
Like it was my God
Looked back and I saw the dark clouds
Took that and I made my mom proud
It's easy to jump when you know how to fall
And lately I fall a lot
Don't wanna sit around and wait, just hanging on a fantasy
I'm trying to be the kind of person who creates an energy
I hope I got the storm inside to maybe make a better me
Some people chalk it up to fate, I don't believe in destiny
I guess I had a spark inside I couldn't light when I was younger
Oftentimes I think you really need to fight to find the hunger
Lightning gets the shine but I've
I've been working on the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder (Hey!) I don't sleep so well at night
Waking up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you (Hey!)

We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you (Hey!)
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you?
Oh-oh oh-oh oh

We are all living, till we grow older (Older, till we're older)
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier (Till we're older, till we're older)
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling (Till we're older, till we're older)

(Older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older)
(Till we're older, till we're older) Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind ohoh
Can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eyes
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
But myself

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
For anyone but myself
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up) Woman help me, you turn my head in circles
Mama blessed me with magnet eyes for purple
Oh so let me show you something good
Pastor, preacher, I wanna say I'm sorry
Nice to meet ya', I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

Auntie Mara, I think you know my reasons
I was a product of everything in season
Oh so heavy, set me free again
Oh my papa, if all the world could know you
You could stop a thousand wars across the globe
Oh I miss ya', show them something good

Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

To me, to me
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Under cover
Just like a candle in the wind

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die?

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming

Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just going to ride it out

Ohh, tell everybody tell everybody

Now we're just gonna ride it out

I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake, it shake it, and we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
Shake it shake it, and we're moving again

Shake it shake it, and we're moving again

Shake it

Every little bit goes a little of a long way
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway
Home, ho-oh-oh-ome (Ho-oh-oh-ome)
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes
No, no-oh-oh-oh (No-oh-oh-oh)

So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do?
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do

Been a long time coming for the working man

Everything is serious and everything is fatal
That's what they tell you and that's how they make you
Know, know-oh-oh-oh (Know-oh-oh-oh)
I'm tired of the books and tired of the tables
Everything is made with the same old labels
No, no-oh-oh-oh (No-oh-oh-oh)

So tell me, tell me, tell me

I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me

Shake it Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Bought a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress
Who was a hostess on the West Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Baby's got a lot of baggage

Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll

Get that dynamite
Chick-a-boom on the town tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight?
Get that dynamite

Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you I get caught in the water, get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river, while the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean, fall deep in the sand
I’m drowned out by the thunder, lost in the land

Is anyone listening?
Is anyone around to see?

That I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go
I’m ready to go
I’m doing it all for you
I’m doing it all for you
I’m ready to go

Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

Ready to go One, two, yeah
A one, two, three, four

I'm broke but I'm happy
I'm poor but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be fine, fine, fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five

I feel drunk but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired but I'm working, yeah
I care but I'm restless
I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be quite alright
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flicking a cigarette

And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving the peace sign

I'm free but I'm focused
I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughing
I'm brave but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playing a piano
And what it all comes down to my dear friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine fine fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab Take me on a whim
It's not the sun that provides us
It's not the moon that divides us
I can barely swim
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

Stand up when you hear your name
Because I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole, but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

I've been painted gin
It's not the color I came in
It's not the shirt that I stain in
Hang me on a limb
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

Stand up when you hear your name
'Cause I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up...

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

It's time to take it over
Step out into the sun
It's time to take it over
And look how far we've come
We've come Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Change will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights, I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh)
I hope to see you again
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh)
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So fly high, so fly high
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh)
So fly high, so fly high Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change a lot and sign our name after the dot
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors that symbolize the things we can attest
Arrange, we can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities to entice and entertain

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me

Take my side
Take my side, don't look back
Now I'm easy and that's a fact
And you're on my mind, oh

Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change and sign our name after the dot

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me

Now will the sun come up tonight?
Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got, when you say that you want it all
You want it all

All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me Emma stood in front of me
Telling me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die
Golly me, oh my, oh my
Cross my heart and hope to die
Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals

Baby, is my love too old for you?
Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you

Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies and playing fun
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
Is owned by hope it's where you're at

Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you

Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence

Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you You've got me feeling like a pantomime
That's why I only love you part time
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more""
You got me feeling like a paradigm
Your friends all want me in the meantime
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more""

Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more""
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone
It's just a matter of ""Oh, don't touch me
Don't you dare touch me no more""

Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

If you've gotta go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah""
You've made it easy for the both of us""
If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah""
You've made it easy for the both of us

Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

If you've got to go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah""
You've made it easy for the both of us
If he's got a chest and some arms
He'll hear me singing you
""Glory! Glory! Hallelujah""
You've made it easy for the both of us I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time
I'm fueled up and high, a man among guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time

I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

Ce soir c'est le soir et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir, très bien ouh la la
I love you all the time
Tu ne réponds pas, ah dis-moi pourquoi
This ain't au revoir, together voilà
I love you all the time

I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

Ah dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi...
Dis-moi pourquoi... There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd cry?
Oh, can you feel my heart?
I think I feel it, too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd die?

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies into the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams, oh

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight Did your mother like your Sunday dress?
Astrology or etiquette?
So what, so what?

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to bind or be set free
So what, so what?
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, so much, so much

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through these shaded trees
Oh, I believe in you
These places, they have changed
I don't know anything, but you know me
Oh, you know me

It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Oh, not at all I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun, alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but I'm changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Ohh-ohh-oh, ohh-ohh-oh
Ohh-ohh-oh, ohh-ohh-oh Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears and
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, no, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
And now you know, you’re free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the worlds inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for—
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, no, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Please believe me, please believe me If I were you, I'd run away
Closin' your eyes and count to ten
Bird in the sky, peace in your mind
Closin' the door on yesterday
So many voices
So many voices

If I was me, weight on my back
Feelin' the sun upon my eyes
Where would I turn? What would I burn?
I am a pawn within your hands
So many voices
So many voices

Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Carvin' in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices

What do I do? Where do I turn?
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two
Either you lose
Or you are bound to be alone
So many choices She barely knew your name

He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing
Running from the country
She needed out, but he held that diamond ring

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name

He was such a worry
No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night
She would never listen
She left it all and headed towards the light
Oh your eyes look tired
But love was all she knew
Screaming out in agony
She gave her life for you

'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
She barely knew your name Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it
The mist of darkness in my head

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh, we can make it out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long as you are with me, friend

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
'Cause you are all I am

Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause Welcome to the land of hire
I hope you brought the right attire
The crippled man is waiting at the door
He said, ""Your eyes are much too bright""
""The things you say are never right""
""The sins of all the world lie on your head""

So when you see me look the other way
'Cause oh, oh, lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say, ""Come with me""

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home, I think he died
The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

So when you see me look the other way
'Cause oh, oh, lately all I do is say
""These plans I make believe all come with me""

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body
I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body
I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be

I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these people flying kites
They seem to live forgotten nights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me

Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh

Oh, get me right, all it takes is starry nights
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these seagulls in the air
They seem to yell just like we care
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me

Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh

I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time, oh, no, oh, no

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
And this is the town, this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
Then so be it

You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Oh take my car, oh take my house
I never liked that beat-up motor mouth
And, oh, it looks so warm tonight
Just like a stranger in the candlelight
Take, take, take, take, take, take it all

Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

Leave me now
Leave me now Draw a rumor; flashing lights and let all whispers die
Sixteen colors, I'm so lonely
Let, let the picture dry

'Cause everybody sees things differently
And everybody says things rationally
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Suppressed emotions flying past
Are heading out the other end
The precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful
Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Are floating past the midnight hour
They push aside the things that matter most
Wonderful

Trace the faces, X the places where the judges lie
I'm not scared of all the nothings
Let, let the whispers die

'Cause everybody sees things differently
(Exciting news at discount price)
And everybody says things rationally
(A million opportunities)
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go...

I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
M-O-V-E-M-E-N-T, oh
I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh
L-E-T-U-S-B-E-F-E-A-R-L-E-S-S

'Cause everybody sees things differently
(Exciting news at discount price)
And everybody says things rationally
(A million opportunities)
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
(Wonderful) One, two, three

First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
Ah, the way that things have been, oh-ooh

Second things second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
Oh, the master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
Who look at me, took on me, shook on me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Yeah, your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open and rained down
And rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flame
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
You're the blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
'Til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer I can never leave you when you're lying in the bed
Face to the wall
Eyes locked on the floor
What did you mean by that, what did you mean by that?
Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that, how could I live like that?
Take it as a self indication
Take it as your own means of vindication
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
It's too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
Oh, it is too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

Living in the darkness
Please
Living, living in the darkness First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Everything you touch turns to gold-

Gold
Gold

Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
You'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Gold
Gold
Gold
Everything you touch turns to gold-

Gold
Gold

I'm dying to feel again
Anything at all
But I feel nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Gold
Gold
Gold
Gold

Gold

When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They’ve always been so kind
But now they’ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
That they have stolen from us

'Cause I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it, shouldn't talk about it

The coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
It's caused by absence of you
Suspense is controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

'Cause I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don’t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn’t talk about it
Why you keep on talkin' 'bout it
No, no don't talk about it
Don't you dare talk about it Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!

Looking to the lonely telegraph that crept into your room
Listen to the bleeding voices of the ones around her tomb

The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing

Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, you don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do

I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into the fading black
I can take you home, now you can be a home
And we'll never look on back

The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing

Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight

They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do
Oh, London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
And I don't want to die
No, I don't want to die
Tonight

Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
And we drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins all dying
We're begging for a reason
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!

Now, come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
We drift along a flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins all dying
We're begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in how we're living
Story with no ending
The storm is beating down
But we're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you

Every single day
Every word you say
Every bond you break
Every single day
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see?
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every breath you take

Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you #""30 Lives""

Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
One step at a time, they are walking a line down a false, false hope

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
The laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay?
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

Well, I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
The laughter is the only sound we'd hear

If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, well, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Oh, my dear it's a pistol whip to my
Broken head and the stars are spinning
So, I pick one up and put it on my shoulder
Look, look, look
You're a world class case, I'll punch my stomach
All the people see me rolling over
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with a star like I told ya
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean

Saddle sore and breathing heavy
I fall four flights up, halfway steady
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with a star like I told ya
Look, look, look
I'ma take ten steps and close my eyes
Turn around and draw to my surprise
I clutch my heart and scream yeehoo!
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I don't want to hear the words leave your lips
Love's lyrics leave you missing life
Tell yourself a lie and look through the crosshair
Tie that blindfold tight
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn, whoa
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got a
A lot of rope to burn, lot to learn whoa
I don't want to hear you say you believe when you don't

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss, but being a killer
Stars on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on

If there is a load
You have to bear
That you can't carry
I'm right up the road
I'll share your load
If you just call me

Call me if you need a friend
Call me, call me, uh-huh
Call me when you need a friend
Call me if you ever need a friend
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me if you need a friend
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me, call me
Call me  When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon (ah-oo)
Should tumble and fall
The mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me


And darlin', darlin', stand by me, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, make news
Open places, question rules
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

So come on boots, oh, walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream (yeah)

Wait, explain, you're zippin' off
Don't let it off so easy
What did you mean?
Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T?
Kiss, lights, make news
Open places, question rules
Stop tryin', you vagabond
What you see is what you get
Stop trying to be somebody else

So come on boots, oh, walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life, don't wanna hear one thing (Ya-hoo)
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream

Oh I don't want to see your face in this broken town
(I don't want to see your face in this broken town)
I'm runnin' down South to bury my head in the ground
(Runnin' down South, bury my head in the ground)
Oh, I don't need money and I don't need you
But if you come around I gotta think of you home

Boots, oh walk me home
Where Daddy works and Momma sews
Just wanna live my life (Wanna live my life)
Don't wanna hear one thing
Oh, I plug my ears and live the dream Say goodbye to all your friends
They will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it

When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)
Leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it
Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it Are you guys ready?

Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
I'm not a yes sir, I'm not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, thunder (yeah)
(Woah) thunder

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
You're dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder thun
Thunder th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder


Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder, thunder

Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder
Thunder, I feel the thunder
Lightning then the thunder

Never give up, never give up, never give up on your dreams
Never give up, never give up, never give up on your dreams
Ohhh, ohhh I do what it takes

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes (oh)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh)
('Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins)
I do what it takes
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins (oh)
I do whatever it takes (oh)
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes (oh)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh)
('Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins)
I do what it takes
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of me

I do what it takes
I do what it takes
I do what it takes
I do what it takes
I do what it takes Rise up this mornin'
Smiled at the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sittin' on my doorstep
They're singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Singing, ""this is my message to you""

Singing don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
I'm singing don't worry 'bout a thing
Now don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Rise up this mornin'
Smiled at the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sit by my doorstep
They're singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Singing, ""this is my message to you""
This is for you

Singing don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
I'm singing don't worry 'bout a thing
Now don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
One more time now

Singin' don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
Now don't you worry
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright It's a, a strange thing
Just a miracle dream
To be at peace with a fling
What if I more than crushes?
And move passed more than just lust
To feel it deep inside
Crying out my trust
It's undescribibly pushin' it
My mind is uncertainty
Beside I want a love that's all certain
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world
To find a woman with certainty
Being my whole life earnin'
But, my baby, what's burnin'?
Discernin' it comes from the heart
That the mind of the eyes
A dark curtain containin'
Capable commissions of hearts

Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)
I am me (I am me)
And you are mine (You are mine)

Well, I'm here with you, today

When I first met you, (ooh)
I was so short of breath
I stared like a child who (ooh)
Who was faking as deaf
You smiled and I laughed (ooh)
And you asked me some questions
But baby, all I kept thinkin
Was taking first kissin' lessons (first kissin' lessons)
Blessings seem to be pourin' (ah)
From right at the start
You searched deep down inside and know to follow your heart (ah)
I followed this path (ah)
It's leading to you
I've arrived at the 'X,' baby, tell me what to do (tell me what to do)

Here we go (Here we go)

I'mma follow my heart (I will follow)
It's led me well (It has led me)
Well, I'm here with you, today

What does it mean to be a perfect match? (ooh)
I love, I love to be so far from perfect
What does it mean to be a perfect catch? (ooh)
I love, I love, I love to love you lady; never, ever leave me
Believe me (ooh)
I can see we'll be the small seed that grows into the stars
(ooh) It's a capable collision of hearts, yeah

Here we go (Here we go)
You and I (You and I)

And you are mine (You are mine)
I'mma sing it out (Sing it out)

Well, I'm here with you, today Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Music's for the sad men

Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (Forever young)
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path?

And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, whoa
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa

Oh, be easy on me baby; I'm a sensitive mess
You're a beautiful girl, nothing else, nothing less
Just tell me what you're feeling what I know to be true
And I'll give all that I have, baby, I'll give it all to you

Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For pretty girl with confidence
Who am I to beat the bush?
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out

Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?

You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?

Alright
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Don't cry mother dear, your boy has left you for a couple years
He's packed his bags, packed in his courage
Put away his fears and stepped into the unknown
And postponed all complications, yeah
A kiss goodbye and an upset stomach sends me on my way
What I believe, it gets me by, it gets me through the days
Tears fall and puddles form and days without an end
Determination never building, the war has just begun

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home

Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

1, 2, 3, 4, take the lead and I'll follow you
You're the man with the plan, I'm the pawn in your hand
Piece to be played, sacrifice to be made
It's my fate in your hands
With my brothers by my side, form a line, shoulders tight
I will push the right, oh will you push the left-right?
If one man falls, they don't move 'til he's up
A one man unit at the wrist, our handcuff
It's handcuff

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home

Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms
Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms

And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men go home I am aching, near breaking
I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, woah, dance with you, oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, competing for a chance with you, oh, whoa

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I could stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

I freeze, I feel debris, my hands been seized
My thoughts are cut, I close my eyes shut
Knowing it's not you, but there's a chance it's you
For a dance with me, oh, woah, hey, woah-oh-oh

Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you I love you, you
Running back oh, back to, back to you, you, you, you
I see your anger and hate and I hear ya say, say, say
Let me hear you out at night
And after that I hope you're bulletproof
Then that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

 Tomorrow, oh, today here comes the rain
I don't want to, I don't wanna explode, I don't want to explode
When I see your anger awaits
I will never say I 
Say, say, say  but I, but I thought I'm bulletproof
And that's okay

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well

Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
Wish you well,  wish you well, I wish you well Oh let's take it slow, I'm just a little too bold
I'm growing older than my age
I can't believe, I can't believe that
You've been on my mind
Oh, call it like you see it, I'm a little too early
Let it be, I'm just a puddle of mud
Staining everything
I see that walks all over me

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

Wise men say I'm foolish, I just give 'em all a grin
Though eyes are prudent, never walking on a limb
I live on stars that burn so bright they close their eyes
Typically I'm weak when I'm a little bit nervous
Oh, you think I'm such a competent fool
I'm telling everyone I know I'm strobing streets

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be

I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe
I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it?

I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be
I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young Lost at sea, so unexplored, tomorrow the world goes dark
Bring you home, tell me why
She lives to hear me talk about
Where the dreams, they cry
And hit, oh, high my face for more
The  move just wanna know
She's all I want so 

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Set me free from all the fields of all the squinted eyes
Tell me why the sun, it died
Tell me all the lies you hear
About a time when I was young
And all I hear was trying to find

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Kiss me when the sun is gone
Hold me in your arms
Tell me why this darkness is a lie upon the stars

Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you One, two, three

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a race horse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
Yet a masterpiece, yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave my body and my soul to be a part of me
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
I do whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
You take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes (oh-oh-oh!)
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It won't stop, I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up, I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again, then I bumped again

Said how do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to the place
Where you said?

I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
And when I'm with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right, all right
And when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
You're the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties, they pass the test
Slide up around the belly face
Down on the mattress one
And you hold me and we are broken
Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now
Feel myself head made of the ground
I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no
And I won't run for my life
She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right, all right

And I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo

The sky was gold, it was rose
I was taking sips of it through my nose
And I wish I could get back there, some place back there
In the place we would start out lives
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs sold upon the streets
Terrorism and alcoholism
These selfish motives guide the world
Weeping mothers, woah, crying fathers
What has this world come to?

They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?

Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die

Grew up for business
I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless you're paid
One night stands and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I shoot 'em up and take 'em down
I don't bleed on my ground

They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing?
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it?

Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die
Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
Singing to the people
Let's live until we die Good morning, my love
It's been a while since we have talked
You have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning, myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over

Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friends
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
1, 2, 3, 4

Do you realize it's almost come?
Do you realize it's almost come?
Walkin' for a while until its done
Beatin' on my back and tell it to run
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open

Lay me down
Lay me down

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight

Do you realize it's almost here?
Do you realize it's almost here?
Walkin' for a while into this year
Beatin' on my back until it's here
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open

Lay me down
Lay me down

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight

Covered moonless night
Light my night, starlight
Light the sky
Light our sky, oh
Again, my friends

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause when this world is beating down on me
I'll search for light to set me free
Oh, save me, starlight
And when this love is all you used to know
I'll search for light to let you go
Oh, save me, starlight You give me love
But then you take it away
And I'm left to search where to hide
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
Come in from your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall

You give me angst
Oh, all I need is a break
From your clever little lies
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times

I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love (Love), love (Love)
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take
But don’t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
Come in from your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall

It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
Ah, ah, ah
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin
It's 2 AM in the city of sin, it's 2 AM in the city of sin

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
Come in from your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent, now
To pay our share

Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning

The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent, now
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
We're gonna give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning My calloused hands
My crippled wings
My calloused hands, my crippled wings, they bring you in

I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, woah
Your crowded hair falls down a narrow hallway

Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move

Your scribbled masterpiece
And written poetry

'Cause I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, woah
A sky of hands that rains down heavy on us

Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move

Come out I'm waiting on the front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along a flooded
Sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins all dying
We're begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Believe in what we're living
A story with no ending
The storm is beating down
Come out I'm waiting on the front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along a flooded
Sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins all dying
I'm begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Believe in what we're living
A story with no ending
The storm is beating down

We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky I'm wakin' up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathin' in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping out, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa

I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red for the blood that rose
Whoa
I'm breakin' in, shapin' up
Checkin' out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa

I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun it hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, I'ma make my mark, even when they start their Martial Law
Even when these Martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Lord, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't really care and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, with no amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
Yeah!

I'm wakin' up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time, can you
Hey
Can you feel me with time
Oh
Can you feel me with time, can you
Can you feel me with time, can you feel me
Can you feel me with time
Radioactive, radioactive Close my eyes so tight I might not realize you're gone
I tell a million stories like I'm old and she's young
It's cold out here at night but I don't mind
I feel the heat creeping up my spine, but it's alright
It's alright

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

February seems to be the worst of all my friends
She brings in all the darkness when the year, it just begins
But, oh, it seems so calm at the strangest of times
Loneliness, it seems to be the worst of all her crimes
And I'm alright
It's alright

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

Don't you let me go
I'm holdin' on
I will let you know
What's going on
You're the reason why I sing this song
(Ohh)

I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
And oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in

Well, it's time to start the show
I lost my heart and lost my soul
And now it's time that you won't know
I lost my mind and lost my goal

Mm, not giving in
I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in, yeah

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in

Waste my time which makes things worse
Lost in mine, my love is cursed
Time to make these things feel right
Woah, let's start this show for one last time

Oh, I'm not giving in
(Not giving in)
Not giving in
(Not giving in)
Not giving in
(Not giving in)
Not giving in

This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in

Not giving in
I'm not giving in
Not giving in, ooh
Not giving in, ooh
Oh, I've gotta be stronger
Oh, I've gotta be stronger
Oh, I've gotta be stronger Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, c'mon!

(Woohoo!) When I hear heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) When, I'm comin' up easy
All of the time when I get that way, it ain't easy
But nothin' else is!
Woohoo!

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

(Woohoo!) When I hear heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) When, I'm comin' up easy
All of the time when I get that way-zay
But nothin' else is!

Woohoo!
(Now) woohoo!
Woohoo! I pledge to the morning light
I gotta heed the way just to fall behind
Breathe and die
I say I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back
Take me home tonight
Breathe and die

We all gonna fall, hey hey
We fall down, we all fall down
Weep behind your eye
We fall down, we all fall down

Make my way where the sirens sleep
Take my mind and spare myself weak
Breathe and die
Say I don't care you really don't care
It's easy to die
Breathe and die

We all gonna fall
We fall down, we all fall down
Weep behind your eye
We fall down, we all fall down
Done tell you want to do

I try to speak my mind to you
Don't tell you what to do
Don't let it feel so lonely, oh, oh
Hope your eyes  the blue
When the seasons see right through you
You know, you know I'll be with you, ooh
I'll be with you, ooh (Ha!)

We all gonna fall
We fall down, we all fall down
Weep behind your eye
We fall down, we all fall down So this is what you meant?
When you said that you were spent?
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a raincheck

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am It's time for us to go to sleep
These walls will never let us breathe
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you
Because you asked me to (oh)
You...
I fill, I fill my lungs with you
Oh... If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on

I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no

Help me out
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burn, oh-whoa
You know you got to help me out, yeah Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones

         Oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh
Oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh, oooo-ooh

I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life

Don't tell me that I'm wrong, don't tell me that I'm wrong
Please forgive me
Don't tell me that I'm wrong, don't tell me that I'm wrong
Please forgive me
For all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my on you ...yesterday
And I'm falling into you
We make the nights side by side today
Outside in this rain has come away
On the side of the road
Took me to your house...


Just for you got the eyes with the broken dreams
And all I ever wanted was a second to breathe a day
Now look out to sea as it comes you
But only for a second, then it sinks into the deep
I'm so far away
And I’m falling to the sea… Babe, don't you let me go
Don't leave me 'cause you love me
I can see it in your sigh
And your hollowed-out goodbye
I know you feel it in that shaking voice at night
I hope it burns into your feathered eye on a bye
I am just a sailor and... What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I’m a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Mm, she’s running out the door
She's running out
She's run, run, run, run
Run

Everyone feel peaceful tonight? Peace and love that's what music is about. I don't care if it's corny; peace and love See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
And I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body's bruised she's got me with
There's nothing to win
And there's nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you
Alright we gotta be heard, help me out

Ohh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa
Oo-oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo-oo

With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you
One more time, here we go
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, ohh-oh-oh-oh
Ohh-oh-oh-oh, oh-whoa
With or without you Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and pretend
She’s sober, bored, and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah


I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, and I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always have until the end

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it’s less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah


Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido

A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial {Verse 1]
Here I stand on the wall
The blood is on my hands, the blood is on my hands
Here you stand on the wall
The blood is on your hands, the blood is on your hands

Take me from this place
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa... Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

'Cause maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now

And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
And after all
You're my wonderwall
'Cause maybe ('Cause maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
And after all
You're my wonderwall
'Cause maybe ('Cause maybe)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me)
You're gonna be the one that saves me (That saves me) When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
No matter what we breed, no matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
No matter what we breed, no matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made

Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
No matter what we breed, no matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
No matter what we breed, no matter what we breed, what we breed
We still are made of greed, still are made of greed, still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons, demons, demons
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you, you, you, you
I, I bet my life, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my, I bet my life on you
Life Oh-woah
We all scream out
""Give, give it a break""
These walls won't fall
Give, give it a break
Tired of the fire in the fireplace
Tired of the world 
Now true Good morning, my love
It's been a while since we first talked
And I have grown
My eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
But I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning, myself
It's been a while since we have spoken
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
I am sure
You'll keep living and breathing until this world rolls over

Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
And I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Stay with me, stay with me
Forever

Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
And I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!

My calloused hands
My crippled wings
My calloused hands, my crippled wings, they bring you in

I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, woah
A sky of hands that rains down heavy on us

Oh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Your scribbled masterpiece
And written poetry

But I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, woah
A sky of hands that rains down heavy on us

Oh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Come out I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along a flooded
Sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins all dying
Begging for a reason
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh! Oh, no
Oh, come out I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in from the back door
Drift along a flooded
Sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying
Tears of sins all dying
Begging for a reason
Year seems like a season
Belief in how we're living
A story with no ending
The storm is beating down

We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
Sinking to the sky
Ah! Oh, it's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
Now the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breakin' me out
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for Love at First Sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane


Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Ring-a-ding-a-dong, ding-dong-dong

I’m dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white


Oh, I, I, I, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up then
Checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, radioactive, radioactive
Oh, oh, radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

I'm radioactive, radioactive
I'm radioactive, radioactive

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, radioactive, radioactive
Oh, oh, radioactive, radioactive

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh (radioactive, radioactive)
Oh, oh (radioactive, radioactive) I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never hurt at all of our energy
Bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sin and those are leaving but are changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

Oh, oh, oh, oh Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone

I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away (Oh, let it drift away)

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I've takin' for granted

I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away (Oh, let it drift away)

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved (Oh, let it drift away)
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved I'm feeling rough, I’m feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I’ll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And **** with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars

This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Put down and that will be the end
We're fated to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my father, miss my mother
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start anew
The models will have children, we’ll get a divorce
We’ll have some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We’re fated to pretend

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down

No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
In a world that keeps on draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down

Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I stand my ground
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down


I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, I won't back down
No, I won't back down A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you


No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his eyes are wide

Exit the warrior
Today's Tom Sawyer
He gets high on you
And the energy you trade
He gets right on to
The friction of the day If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in, but don't look down...

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-woah, oh-oh

'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make your round, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now...
And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up and you make your round, but
Get up, now, get up, get up, now...

I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world Ooo-oo, ooo-oo
Ooo-oo, ooo-oo

I'm waking up to ash and dust
Wipe my brow but I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

Breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my system blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flag, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
And we're painted red just to fit right in, whoa

I'm breaking in, and shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age

Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa – I'm radioactive, radioactive

Radioactive, radioactive I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She is playing with her jewelry, she is putting up her hair
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

I want a girl who gets up early (Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late (Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation (Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends (Good dividends)
At Citibank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen
She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She is changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She is trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, ooo-oo
So I, ooo-oo

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, ooo-oo
So I, ooo-oo
So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my, I bet my, I bet my
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my
So I, ooo-oo
So I, ooo-oo So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top (right to the top)
Don't hold back (don't hold back)
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top (right to the top)
Don't look back (don't look back)
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes (to ashes)
Now don't you understand?
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand (understand)
That I'm never changing who I am Ooo-oo
Ooo-oo

I'm sorry, mother
I'm sorry I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine
No, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man
Ooo-oo
Ooo-oo
I'm sorry, brother
I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days you're fine
No, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I keep coming up short

Ooo-oo
I'm sorry, brother
I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days you're fine
No these days you tend to lie
I kinda thought I was a mystery
And then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations, you were all alone!""

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun can't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me, I've tried
But I won't wait much longer
Oh, these walls, they're crashing down
Oh, I won't wait much longer
Oh, these walls, they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short Shh, Alex da Kid is coming
Demons, demons, my demons

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Demons, my demons, my demons
My demons, my demons, my demons

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Demons, my demons, my demons
My demons, my demons, my demons

Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing

With the clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, yeah
The Rodeo Clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down

The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women and
The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things

Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard
Yeah, yeah
The changes occurred
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd

Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying

With the rest of the clowns
Yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm
With the rest of the clowns


Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music Oh, hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Oh, hang me up to dry
Oh, I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes


Oh, hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Oh, hang me up to dry
I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, ""Don't you know?"" You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""
I say, ""Don't you know?"" You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""
Well, I say, ""Don't you know?"" You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, ""Don't you know?"" You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on now, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Mhm, I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me


Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me


But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life

I've been around the world
And never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies, but
Now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do

Now remember when I told you
That's the last you'll see of me?
Remember when I broke you down to tears?
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life

Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me
-Give me, -give me, -give me, -give me, -give me, -give me

I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life I don't ever wanna leave this town
This city never sleeps at night

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

Never changing who I am
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am...

Am, am, am, am, am, am
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
Never changing who I am
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am...

Am, am, am, am, am, am
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
Never changing who I am
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
And I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to spark my imagination
I can't get no - oh no, no!
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
C'mon now

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
About how white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man, 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, no no no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say


I can't get no
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction
No satisfaction, no satisfaction You don't stop, you run

Oh, I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone

I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

That I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved
That I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, that I loved, That I loved, that I loved

In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
And there's always time to change your mind

I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals

I'm breaking in, shaping up
Then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse – whoa

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones (bones, bones, bones...)
Enough to make my systems blow (blow, blow, blow, blow...)

Radioactive, radioactive
Radioactive, radioactive

I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa

I'm breaking in, shaping up

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones (bones, bones, bones...)

That I'm never changing who I am When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
Dreams all fail, and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
They dug your grave and the masquerade
Calling out at the mess you made

I don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, I don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide So this is what you meant

We are very excited to be hosting Imagine Dragons
Due to s—
*Crowd cheers and claps*

Of course, you all know ’cause you all have your copies of 'Night Visions' in hand
So, uh, let’s hear some music
Please, everybody, welcome Imagine Dragons!
*Crowd cheers and claps*
Well, aren't you guys a wonderf—
Aren't you guys a wonderful, uh, sight for sore eyes
We haven't played in front of people in so long and I don't know what to do
*band tunes instruments*
So, we are, uh…
The four of us make up Imagine Dragons, which, uh, is a band from Las Vegas
*Crowd cheers*
And, uh, I have something I'm going to share with you guys that I wasn't going to say but I thought-
Say it!
Yeah
*Crowd laughs*
There's no secrets here
Um,
So, I u— I underwent, uh, a vocal surgery a month ago, uh, for my vocal chords
Uh, just, it’s been three years of wear and tear
And, uh, but the good news is it went really well
And I’m speaking, which is good
But, uh—
*Crowd cheers*
But, uh, the doctor told me I should not sing for another, uh, week until the tour
But, uh, we had this planned for quite a while and…
So, I don't recommend doing what I’m about to do but…
*Crowd laughs*
I did insist that we came here still and at least played a few songs for you guys
Uh, 'cause I know that many of you planned to come out here for a while
And, uh, it's important to me, ya know, that we keep our promises to you
Uh, 'cause you guys have supported us so much in the years that we’ve been together
And, uh, I wanna tell you that that means a lot to us and this is the least that we could do is come out and play some songs for you, so
Um, we hope that you enjoy it
And, uh, feel free—
*Crowd cheers*
Thank you
Feel free to sing along with us
Don't be shy
And, uh, again, thank you for coming out
And peace and love to all of you

And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved


In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved
(Let me make it up to you)

In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
'Cause you've always got to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
(Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved...) In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream

I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already
Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface.. So if you're tired of the
Same old story
C'mon c'mon c'mon
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Yeah, whoo

As soon as you are able
Woman I am willing
To make the break that we
Are on the brink of
My cup is on the table
Our love is spilling
Waiting here for you to
Take and drink of

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh yeah
C'mon baby

I knew it had to happen
Felt the tables turnin'
Got me through my darkest hour
I heard the thunder clappin'
Felt the desert burnin'
Until you poured on me
Like a sweet sunshower

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Yeah

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Baby

You gotta keep on, keep on rollin'
You gotta keep on, keep on rollin'
(I won't stop rollin')
You gotta keep on, keep on rollin'
(I won't stop rollin') Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break?
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind ohoh
Can you hear me?

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away!

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too? I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
This city never sleeps at night
This city never sleeps at night
I'm never changing who I am
I'm never changing who I am
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sail
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

But I'm wishin' you're gone

I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up

Over again

And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
