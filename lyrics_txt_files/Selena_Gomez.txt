"You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me

You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus

To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah

And now the chapter is closed and done
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you) Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love I was walking down the street the other day
Tryna distract myself
But then I see your face
Oh wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room there's a king size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no
Not to give in to you
No, no, no, no

With my feelings on fire
Guess I'm a bad liar

I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

Ooh you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooooh every time I watch you serpentine

Oh I'm tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin'
Oh tryin', I'm tryin', I'm tryin'

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

Wow, look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go

Only if she wants it
She knows she'll find love
Wow, look at her now I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find

Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me

Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh

When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone

Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody

Every time you dance with somebody

Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh (Do you feel me?)
Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)
Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh

Every time your lips touch another
Oh
Every time you dance with somebody Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe
I'm on my knees right now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up

Rare Chills

New York back in August, tenth floor balcony
Smoke is floating over Jane and Greenwich street
Goosebumps from your wild eyes when they're watching me
Shivers dance down my spine, head down to my feet

Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak
Taking my breath, a souvenir that you can keep

Giving me chills
Chills

Sunset Tower lobby, waiting there for me
In the elevator, fumble for your key
Kissed in every corner, Presidential Suite
Opened that Bordeaux from 1993

Swimming in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes
Egyptian blue
Something I've never had without you

You're giving me chills at a hundred degrees
It's better than pills how you put me to sleep
Calling your name, the only language I can speak

Take my breath away just like a souvenir
Giving me chills
Take my, take-take my breath away just like (You're giving me chills)
Take my breath away just like a souvenir If I give you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key, and keep it there forever in your pocket
If I give the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing to happen to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it? Would you grow it?
I'ma give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

If I hand you my emotions, would you even wanna take it?
(Would you even wanna take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mm, mm, mm, mm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it, would you wanna make it?)
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it? (Ooh)

If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable


If I show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets, wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you, only you
Only you, only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
Only you You were runnin' through me like water
Now the feeling's leavin' me dry
These days, we couldn't be farther
So how’s it feel to be on the other side?

Ooh, you'll really wanna know where I've been all this time
So lemme tell ya
Ooh, got two feet on the ground and felt what real is like
What it was like
Livin' out of the scene, out in the wild
Learnin' to breathe

Holdin' hands with the darkness and knowin' my heart is allowed
Allowed

Gotta chop-chop all the extra weight
I've been carrying for fourteen-hundred-sixty days
Gotta, gotta, gotta clean my slate

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah
The truth is that I think I've had enough
Professionally messin' with my trust
How could I confuse that shit for love?

So I gotta get
You out my head now
I just cut you off
You out my head now
I just cut you off
When I'm without you
I don't overthink it, I just carry on, get
You out my head now
I just cut you off

I imagine all the endless places I could know
If I drop-drop and I let you go
All the possibilities I got from head to toe
Yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd, yeah, they'd start to show

And I might as well just tell you while I'm drunk, yeah

You out my head now
I just, I just, yeah Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect Happiness
Ain't something you sit back and you wait for
Mmm, ah
Confidence
Is throwing your heart through every brick wall
Mmm, ah

I kickstart the rhythm
All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission

Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in with everything
To dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

Vulnerable
Ain't easy, believe me, but I go there
Mmm, ah
It's like I'm ten feet tall
I'm high off the weight off of my shoulders
Mmm, ah

I kickstart the rhythm
All the trauma's in remission
No, I don’t need permission
I kickstart my system
When I speak, my body listens
I know what I'm missing

Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good to dance again
With my emotions undressed, I'm going in with everything
To dance again
Feels so, feels so, feels so good

Feels so, feels so, feels so good We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival

I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle was a revival, revival
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

Every word is relief
I'm in dance floor therapy, all my babies and me
But tonight, it's for free
No self-sabotage, no letting my thoughts run
Me and this spiral are done
Burn this camouflage I've been wearing for months
Tryna let a little happy in for once

I need to let my mind rest
While my body reflects (Ooh)

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me
Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out

Diving in ferociously, dancing intimately
I'm so connected to me
In the dark, I'm letting go, so anonymously
I guess this is what it feels like to be free

I need to let my mind rest (My, my mind)
While my body reflects (Ooh)

Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
Don't get me down, I won't let me get me (Ooh)
I'm good right now, I won't let me get me

Take that tired heart and go and turn it inside-out Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste
Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seein' through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more-ore

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're actin' super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodgin' phone calls lately
But still textin' me, ""Baby""
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it
You've been lyin' just for fun
Luckily, no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Hey, you're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your babe
And now you're treatin' me like I'm insane
You're insane

I think you're kind of crazy

Hmm, I don't know Well, you know everything's gonna to be a breeze
And the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
(Yes please)

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you've never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed!
(That's what I said)

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not... what it seems Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da

She was too young to be the Hollywood type
Too pure to understand the lows and the highs
She didn't know if she was gonna survive
It all got so much better with time

All of the evil eyes
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

'Cause she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

She didn't know all of the hurt she could take
Her world was crumbling and so was her faith
Wish I could talk to her 'cause what I would say
""Oh baby, you're enough to get you out of this place""

All of the flashing lights
Tequila before sunrise
I'd tell her to watch her back
That she's worth more than that

But she was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions
And she learned a couple lessons
Wish I could tell her
She was a girl with good intentions
Didn't need the second-guessing
Didn't need to ever question
Wish I could tell her

Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

I know you'll have a choice before it gets too dark

I know you'll have the choice

She was a girl with good intentions
Yeah, she made some bad decisions

I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we ke-keep this record on rotation

It's The Cataracs
Ha ha ha Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

And if we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
But you don't understand
I don't need a man

I'm just here to turn up
Tonight is just us

Me and my girls
Me and my girls
Me and my girls
No jodas nosotras
Me and my girls No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush

Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, no

Nobody's gonna love me like you

Nobody's ever led me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, can barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
And I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh

Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh

Like you, ooh This is just what the doctor ordered (Yeah)
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry
I'm a sensitive situation (Mmm)
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications (Mmm)
If I'm lookin' at you and me, we're on some kind of symmetry, oh

I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

Can we keep it on a first name basis? (Ah)
We could overcrowd each other's spaces
You get me higher than my medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm gettin' impatient (Ah)

I try not to bother, not to bother you (Ah)
But my kind of trouble likes your trouble too (Ah)

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got somethin' in this room
Can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh
But you look like fun (Mmm, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh

You look like
You don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown
And it's just not right, but you look like
You don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down
And it's just not right that you look like

Fun (Yeah, ow)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun (Ooh, fun)
Oh-oh-oh (Ah), oh-oh-oh
You look like fun Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride You were the one, the one that I could run to
You were the one, the one that I would beg for, no
And you were the one that made me believe that I could be better
Yeah, you were the one, the one that I would run to

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

You had a way of making me feel special, yeah
Then take it away and say I wasn't special, no
And now it's messed up that bad kind of love
Is the only thing that makes me better
Yeah, you had your way
I'm trying to pull myself together

'Cause now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh

Oh, it should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know
It should be easy to let you go
But I love you and I hate that you know

Now I'm stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
Like a goddamn soldier that just can't forget the battle
I am stained by you
Like a coffee ring upon this table
I'm unstable, I am stained by you
By you, by you, oh-oh Ooh, the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me, oh

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah, all I need
Is the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah, the rhythm
Me and the rhythm Hey babe, it's me. Umm I just wanted to call and tell you that I love you so so so so much. I just wanted to let you know that you are my princess, you are worthy of all of the love in the world. You are the love of my life...

Now's all we got
And time can't be bought
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
You said you loved me, I said I loved you back
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
All your promises and all them plans we had
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

The trips we dreamed of taking, the tacks left on the map
What happened to that?
What happened to that?
When all you had was nothing, and all we did was laugh
What happened, what happened, what happened to that?

Boom, gone
Yeah, we move on
Even if we try to forget

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember

Break down the walls, let heaven in
Somewhere in forever, we'll dance again
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up
I still don't know just how we screwed it up
Forever, forever, forever

Love will remember you
And love will remember me
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours
Even if we try to forget, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember
Love will remember, love will remember You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air
You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright, they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat it in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Rise There's a reason you're everywhere
Breathe you in like you're in the air
Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
In my room, from the ceiling to the floor
My body knows that you've been here before

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne

Maybe you should call off the day
Give your girl some time to play
Running my mind cause my heart lost all control
Only one thing that can give me that multiple

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne

All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it
All the way down
Feels like you're around
Forever in the moment
I love it, and you know it

Every second here without you, I pretend we're skin to skin
Every single breath reminds me that you never, ever left
Every time I think about you, I can feel my hand give in
Cause you're keeping me safe and warm
Even when I'm home alone
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne, cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne
Wearing nothing but your cologne Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We catch each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors

(Lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove, lo-o-ove)
They can't steal our love

I can't seem to choose what to do
There's nothing I can say
I'm tired of the fight 'cause I'm never right
I just wanna cry, no

And just when I feel like fallin' down
You pick me up right off the ground
They can't keep between us two right now

They can't steal our love

We’re running out of time, chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
There's always somebody
You’re willing to fight to be right

Your lies are bullets, your mouth's a gun
No war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Please, kill 'em with kindness

So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why love's a lie

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

Swear it drives me crazy
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry, baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die, baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry, baby
Thought you were my ride or die, baby

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love) Everything
Is not
What it seems

Well, you know everything's gonna be a breeze
That the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest of ease
Yes, please
But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report on a book you never read
With the snap of your fingers you can make your bed
That's what I said

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

There's always a lotta people that you need to see
But you got a quick way to get from A to B
Just be careful of who's aware of your reality
You know what I mean!
There's a whole other world that you only know
When you can make yourself invisible from head to toe
But understand, it's not the status quo
Oh, careful what you show!

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh
Oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh

Uh, oh!
Things are getting kind of tricky
But it doesn't mean much to a girl like me
'Cause I can do the things that you'll never believe
Even in your wildest dreams
Well, excuse me
I know it's strange, but true
In my opinion, from my point of view
But once in a blue moon, I don't know what to do
It's like a catch-22

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get all you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not what it seems

Everything is not what it seems
When you can have what you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not
What it seems I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever Snippet

You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos
Low life in this high too
You give me love with an attitude
I throw the drink and the glass through
I see your ex and some brand new
I pack my bags and I'm leaving you

'Cause you've been nothing but bad news, bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
Nothing, a thing but bad news
No one to blame, you're bad news
It's such a shame, you're bad news
I had it good for bad news

You took me under
Fuck me right over
Do what I had to
You knew I'd come back to you, baby

You've been nothing but bad news
Flesh fade in your tattoos

It's such a shame, you're bad news
I had it good for bad news Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name
Gonna write your name

Write your name across my heart
Write your name over every part
And we could be worlds apart
Write your name across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name

Permanent, leave your scar

Poetry in motion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved

It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning
A lazy day in bed
Music in my head
Crazy music playing in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

I love a sunny day
I dream of far away
Dreaming on my pillow in the morning
I've never been awake
I've never seen a daybreak
Leaning on my pillow in the morning light

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so

Oh, oh, oh
It's magic, you know
Never believe it's not so
It's magic, you know
Never believe, it's not so You're so hot, not
But if I can be honest, baby, you're all that I've got
You're so cool, not
But if you didn't notice, you got me playing the fool, with you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

You're so you, ew gross
But there's something about you that's making me feel like I do, with you

'Cause you're not my type
This can't be true
I don't know why I'm all about you
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

Not my type
This can't be, can't be true
We will, I'm all about
If it's real, tell me so, 'cause I'm not letting you go

We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way
We will never change our minds, but I want you to stay
Up all night, cross the line
'Cause wrong is right when we're together
We will never change
In and out of love, but I like it that way

         Happier times flash through my mind
We both say it's over, and I believe it this time
All the pain that I hide
Let it play through the night

A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

I won't regret what I won't forget
Memories and your number are all I have left
I wish you the best, I really do
Even though I know that I'm still not over you
I know that we both are to blame
I can't believe, you didn't fight harder for me

It's a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade

The more you love, the more it hurts
When it ends, when it's over
All that's left are the memories
Playing over, and over
In your head, in your heart
Turn it up, make it stop
Tonight, all over the world
The most beautiful song ever heard

Is a sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
We almost got it right
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
For every broken heart tonight
All the love, that we made
Turn it up, let it play
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade
A sad, sad serenade
Sad serenade My hands on you, don't make me want to leave
I understand you’ve always wanted someone not like me
But I don't wanna keep it all this to myself Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart

(Fly, fly)
Rise to the heights of all you can be
(Fly, fly)
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly...
Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly...
You can fly to your heart Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
The curl of her lips
The ice in her stare
All innocent children had better beware
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Look out for Cruella De Vil

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

This inhuman beast
She oughta be locked up and never released
This world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella, Cruella De Vil, yeah!

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Cruella De Vil

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

At first, you think Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realize
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill, oh, oh

Cruella, Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you, no evil thing will
Cruella, Cruella De Vil
To see her is to take a sudden chill

My legs gettin' tired
From runnin' through your mind all the time
And I know you need a ride
Cold killer, but I'm lookin' summertime fine (ow!)
Hot girl causin' heatwave
I look good on weekends and weekdays
Can't deal with nobody beneath me
I'm 24, gettin' money, 23 ways (gimme some of that)

Captured my attention from the moment we met
I knew it'd be a night that we would never forget
You got me thinkin' dirty, I mean no disrespect
I like the way you keepin' it 100 percent
Give me some of that

Oh, from the way that you move to the way that you touch
Oh, from your head to your lips, to your neck to your butt
Give me some of that
Oh, got me weak in the knees and you're makin' me blush
Never felt like this before

I think I got a girl crush
I think I got a girl crush
A different kind of love, ooh
I think I got a girl crush
Girl crush

We're deep in our emotions, I ain't seen this before
I'm messing with your style, you make me wanna explore
The way you rock those faded jeans, you know I adore
So come a little closer baby, give me some more
Give me some of that

Oh, from the way that you move to the way that you touch
Oh, from your head to your lips, to your neck to your butt
Give me some of that
Oh, got me weak in the knees and you're makin' me blush
Never felt like this before

I think I got a girl crush
I think I got a girl crush
A different kind of love, ooh
I think I got a girl crush
Girl crush

Wake us up, they goin' and the night is young
I just wanna take you by the hand and run
Show you that tonight you'll be the only one
You can have it all
We can have a slumber party just for two
Turn my favourite light and turn the music on
Nothin' else would come between me and you, you, you
I think I got a...

Rules to the game is bad bitches come first
And I'm a bad bitch, boy I might just be the worst
Promise I'm a problem in some heels and a skirt
Keep your feelings in your pocket 'less you wanna get 'em hurt
Everybody mad at me, what's the fuss about
The crowd went wild when I stuck it out
I take my time with it, I don't rush a lot
Iggy ain't a playa', I just crush a lot

Girl crush
I think I got a girl crush
A different kind of love, ooh
I think I got a girl crush
Girl crush

Girl crush
Gimme some of that
Girl crush
A different kind of love, ooh
I think I got a girl crush
Girl crush In the dark, we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from a world outside we know
In your lips, I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly
When you lay over me
Run away from a world outside we know

And when I'm waking next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
Used to be
I'm never giving up on this

The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (ah, oh, yeah)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

Thinking, reminiscing
My night's pretty lit, but it's just you missing
Wishing I could be the light in your life
The way still light might bleed through night
Thoughts of you on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I should be baby-girl living, I know we left messy, but it all is forgiven
Ringing your line, hoping it will go through, and maybe one more time, we could talk this through
Go back to you
Thoughts of you are on my mind
I'm searching and I hope one day I can find it
But no one ever feels good, it's never just right
That's why...
I know I'd go back to you

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you All I need is love
That’s what you give
I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That’s what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are when everything's a lie
All I need is here, right where you are
You're every reason why

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together 24/7
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together
And all of the colors brighter
'Cause you set me up on fire
'Cause you set me up on fire
'Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you
The music feels better with you We the flying...
Fast... Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned! It's driving me crazy
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
He's in my head and
I can't get him out
I need medicine, to help me out
'Cause he's stuck on my brain
And I can't get him out
Out of my head
And I can't get you out
Out of my head
My head
My head Selena: Guess I did it. Finally, I get to host the EMA's. Wow...
Selena's reflection: Seriously? Shut your face. Who else could it be?

Who else better then me to be hosting the show?
People know who the eff I is; I'm a pro
The right time and place for me to be
Yeah, I'll say it, congratulations to me
So here we go, another page in my legacy
Belfast, wait until they get a load of me
EMA's, that's where all the stars are gonna be
But most importantly...

Congratulations to me
Who's the hostess with the mostest? (Right)
I'm gonna be the focus (only)
Congratulations to me, yeah
S-E-L-E-N-A to the Gomez
Yeah, you know I'm a dopest

Listen up, listen up
It's fucked crazy growing up in this industry
I was still a baby when I hustled up into the scene
Fuck you if you dare stand in front of me
But that's okay, you see, 'cause now I'm the queen
No, no, no I don't wanna be misunderstood
I hope you haters know I've always done the best I could
Don't listen to her Selena, don't let her get in your head
But then again I wish you fuckbutter would

I dedicate this song to everyone named me
Selena G, I'm known for my modesty
I dedicate this song to everyone named me
You got the gist of the song
Now sing along

Congratulations to me
Who's the hostess with the mostest? (Right)
I'm gonna be the focus (only)
Congratulations to me, yeah
S-E-L-E-N-A to the Gomez
Yeah, you know I'm a dopest Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

You got a fetish for my love
You got a fetish for my love

Reaching your limit
Say you're reaching your limit
Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Something about me
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami

I'm not surprised
I sympathize, ah
I can't deny
Your appetite, ah

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

You got a fetish for my love
You got a fetish for my love
You got a fetish for my love
You got a fetish for my love

It's Gucci!
The way you walk, the way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina
Just need you in a blue bikini

You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby Mom always said that books could take you to another world
But I don't think that this is what she meant
(This is what she meant)
I'm shuttling through these distant lands and ocean shores
Don't really know where I'll go next
'Cause I've been...

(Aaaaaaah toooo) So

My body feels like chess , no no no it's not stress

When I see my Totem, I remind that I'm not broken Disappear

I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time
That you told me that you'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
I should have learned my lesson
I keep coming back like a heart attack
That's always breaking

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, ""this time believe me""
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

I don't want to be lonely
But you were always the only
One who cast a spell and made it feel
Like all of this was real
Nothing but an illusion
But I'm not gonna lose you
So just do your trick and make it quick
Cause I'm pretending

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say, ""this time believe me""
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Don't go!

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic when you're gone

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Disappear

You say you don't need me
You say, ""this time believe me""
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear (disappear)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You're walking by, and I trip on the furniture
I'm on a ride that won't stop moving
And I don't know exactly what I'm doing

It's like I won a win race, yeah, I'm winning
I'm all dizzy when you're here with me
So, let's bring the heat

'Cause there aren’t nothing to it (holiday)

We're doing it right when we, we're together
With you by my side, it don't get better
With you on my team got it figured it out
It's you and me
No doubt

'Cause there aren’t nothing to it (holiday)
Just got to do it (every day)
You got to own it, own it

You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

I won't be whining about
What mightn't been
You know I’m not too big on giving in
I use whatever spell the law allows
That is of course, if I knew how

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

You won't know anything unless you try
Might end up falling but you just might fly
You know it's all about what you believe
And maybe something extra up your sleeve

Listen what I say
Nothings getting in our way
There's no fear that can stop us
And no reason to delay
Going to give it all we got
Yeah we aren't afraid to play
So watch out for it, we're going to
Make it happen

We're not afraid to fall
Yeah we're going for it all
There's no nothing to our madness
Yeah we're answering the call
If we used a little magic
Well we really can't recall
All I Know is that we're going to
Make it happen
Ye-ow! Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned! Ever try to reach for something
But it's someone else's dream?
Every step that you take forward
It takes you right back where you been
And then when you least expect it
And you've tried about everything
Somebody hears your opinions
Somebody cares what you see
You woke me up
No longer tired
With you I feel inspired
You help me find my fire
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
Oh trying to do it right
No rehearsals
It's your life
If you're doing this crazy dance
Cause your making these crazy plans
T's just this is not a test
You put in work to be the best
It's a classic take
On a brand new game
Before the needle drops
They're gonna know your name

When it gets old don't lose the light
You're cold, I'll warm you up
Your fire is hot enough, enough, enough
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Trying everything just to touch your dreams
You look so classic, fantastic
Oh when you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that
It's become so hard
For me to be surprised
You're bringing back the real me
No judgment in your eyes
Cause when I dance with you
It's how I speak the truth
Just classic when we met
Now you make me new
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
(Bring the beat back once more)
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You look so classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Bring it back, bring it back
Let me see you do that
You're the new classic
You're the new PYT
Stands for paid, young and
Taking on the world from the driver's seat
You're the new classic, fantastic
When you're on that floor
Bring the beat back once more
Let me see you do that (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Here, (here), you're (higher, higher, higher, higher), higher)
Get me high

Pose for the camera, just pose
Put on some, (Ah) nice clothes
I'm your lover, i'm the one you chose
Just pose, I said, just pose

No one knows, that
We're alone, and
How things go, highs and lows
Go real slow, red rose
Red nose, cons and pros

Babe, I know that you want it
So, babe come upon it
I'll give a private show
Babe, all you have to do is pose

Pose for the camera, just pose
Put on some, (Ah) nice clothes
I'm your lover, i'm the one you chose
Just pose, I said, just pose

Spray me down like a hose, and
So cold, I just froze
Your the one I chose
Throw me something I throw
From my head to my toes
I don't want you to go

Babe, I know that you want it
So, babe come upon it
I'll give a private show
Babe, all you have to do is pose

Pose for the camera, just pose
Put on some, (Ah) nice clothes
I'm your lover, i'm the one you chose
Just pose, I said, just pose

Pose for the camera (just pose)
Aim and shoot just pose for the camera (just pose)
You already know how it goes (just pose)
All you have to do is pose

Babe, I know that you want it
So, babe come upon it
I'll give a private show
Babe, all you have to do is pose

Pose for the camera, just pose
Put on some, (Ah) nice clothes
I'm your lover, i'm the one you chose
Just pose, I said, just pose
Just, just, just, just pose I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so far away
So far away
Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would go away
Just go away

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
(My name, my name...)

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love
Made to rule the world
Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever knew my name
My name, my name, my name Rabbits hopping through the fields
Monkeys swinging from the trees
Lions are the king of the forest
But the scariest things alive...
It's dark outside
There’s a moonlight
The dark scares me
But I won't believe
That you love me
Cause I know you don't
You’re a filthy liar
Who likes Mickeyds
Who orders everything
Cheeseburger and select chicken
What are you talking about
Oh no one important
Ok
A1nyway
Let's say ohhhhhhh
Oh yeah
All night long
Up from top now
Now ohhhhhhhh
All night long
Alright
All night looooooooong
A pretty tired what about you
A little bit tired
What about we wrap this mother up
Wrapping it up, wrapping it up (wrapping it up, wrapping it and wrapping it up)
And scene
Ouch my ears are bleeding

         Just drive, I'm sick of talking
We know where this is going
I'm done, take me home
I can't wait forever
For you to get yourself together
I'd rather be alone

I'm so tired of pretending
Just want a happy ending

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

You taught me what I know
Guys like you come and go
But I know things can change

See, my heart, it may be broken
But that won't stop me hoping

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
Make it all come true

I just want to know what we should have done
Want to figure out what we could have become
Because I know in my heart I'm not over you
I just want to go back and try it again
Turn back the time, this isn't the end of us
It isn't the end of us, it isn't the end of us

(Whoa) Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet? (Oh)
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

Wish I could put a spell on you
Wish I could make you feel like I do
Wouldn't that be sweet?
So magical
Wish I could flick and wave a wand
Get everything that I ever wanted
And put a spell on you
And make it all come true

Cause I'm onto you
Keep on the low I'll be waiting for
Oh

Let's go right now
Gotta' hit the ground
Dancing 'fore the music slows down
What I'm sayin', what I'm sayin'
If there's something to fix
Take it to another level
This is the remix
Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, till you ""rock it""
We can't take it no more
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off
Shake it up! Shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up! Shake it up!
Break it down, break it down
I've got something to say
When you're dancing with me
It's like we go M-I-A
Make a scene, make a scene
Nobody can ignore
Don't knock it, till you rock it
We can't take it no more
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust your self off
Shake it up! Shake it up!
DJ set it off
Take it up a notch
All together now
Shake it up! Shake it up!
Sh-sh-sh-Shake it up

And if the days not right

Put on your attitude
Your in my pocket, move
And when you've had enough
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!
Bring the lights up
Bust the doors down
Dust yourself off

Close your eyes and trust in me
You can sleep safe and sound
Knowing I am around

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me

Slip into silent slumber
Sail on a silver mist
Slowly and surely your senses
Will cease to resist
Trust in me, just in me
Close your eyes and trust in me Can you feel me when I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute, no matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like I've been wondering the desert for a thousand days
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

The stars are burning, I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning, like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling
It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me
Oh, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me baby, baby, baby, ooh
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here
I can't explain, but day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain, oh
Whoa whoa I was lost
And you were found
You seemed to stand on solid ground
I was weak
And you were strong
And me and my guitar
We strummed along, oh
Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me
I was blind
But oh, how you could see
You saw the beauty in everything
Everything I need
I would cry
And you would smile
You'd stay with me a little while
Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me
And in my heart I see, oh
What you're doing to me
And in my heart I see, oh
Just how you wanted it to be
Sweet misery
Oh, whoa, ohhh
Sweet misery you cause me
That's what you called me
Sweet misery you cause me
And in my heart I see, oh
What you're doing to me
And in my heart I see, oh
Just how you wanted it to be
Sweet misery... ohh, sweet misery, ohh
I was weak
And you were strong
And me and my guitar
We strummed along Roses Is Coming 🌹

         We had our moments. We had our fights. We had the nights were I slept on the coach while you slept in the kitchen. But worst of all, you've cheated multiple times and I'm faded. Now you see me gone. Now you see how tired I was of you
So don't be, coming back to me. After seeing how I am. Cause I hope you know my response
No, don't be running back to me. I don't wanna be, your lover. No, I don't wanna see you anymore. I don't wanna play your games Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking
To myself

All alone
Nobody to just talk to
No skin, just bones
I'm seeing red, but I feel so blue

Oh, i’m talking to myself
And got nobody else
All alone
And there ain't nothing on the shelf
I'm talking to myself, oh, i’m talking to myself
They all say ""She's talking to herself""
To myself

I need a clone
I do, I don't
I'm already grown
Soemthing that's not known

Oh, i'm talking to myself
And got nobody else
All alone
And there ain't nothing on the shelf
I'm talking to myself, oh, i’m talking to myself
They all say ""She’s talking to herself""
To myself

There ain't no way to go
Oh, I am on my own
Ain’t nobody wants to pick up the phone
I'm so blind ain't nothin shown

Oh, i'm talking to myself
And got nobody else
All alone
And there ain’t nothing on the shelf
I'm talking to myself, oh, i'm talking to myself
They all say ""She's talking to herself""
To myself Whenever you're around
Trouble calls my name
But I don’t mind
As long as we conclude the day my way Feeling so good, so great
Until I really look into your eyes
Tell me how bad it is, what you did
'Cause you know that I'm not about that life
Your secrets have secrets, that's no lie
Why we gotta be so under the weather
We can only have ourselves, can't rely on nobody else
To put your pieces back together

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find?
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
Easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

Never would give you away
You'll be unfamiliar with pain
You'll never cry

I've been feeling down for a while
Wishing you could see beyond my eyes
You know very well what I did
Swear that I'm not about that life
I told you my secrets that made you cry
Said you want the truth thought it'd make you feel better
We can only grow from here
Do reconstruction
And put the pieces back together (yeah)

Over and over again
Repeat what you already did
What did you find? (I was wrong, I was wrong)
Nothing has fixed what they said
Except that we don't understand
Why do they lie?

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide

Yeah, If I told you that I miss you
Would you understand it?
Or would you take it for granted?
I miss the little things, talks about the stars and the planets
And you speaking to me in Spanish, ""Te extraño""
Can't even lie
Lately things have been different
You was my sweet tooth
Now it seems I need a filling
And now that the pain is numb, I'm looking for a feeling
The fast life isn't as appealing
You still listening?
If you are, I wonder how you have been nowadays
I know we haven't talked much since we parted ways
I know I missed your birthday, a couple of holidays
I never knew it'd be this hard with you far away
Secrets, all this over some secrets
I look back and tell myself to keep it
I wish that I had looked you in the eye and just told you a lie
'Cause I cared too much to see you cry

It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide (yeah, yeah)
It'll be easy, just release yourself and trust in our hearts to decide Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
So you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we ke-keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
'Til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

The music's got me going

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We’re running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You’re willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war in anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

And no war in anger was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you’re fighting

Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness, kill 'em with kindness
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, go 'head now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back, back, back
I know I'd...

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, I'd go back to you)
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you,  I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
And now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find

You'll always be alone (Alone)

Just so you don't dream?

Every time your lips touch another (Touch another)

Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good, make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours

And still look good for you, good for you

Could even make that Tiffany jealous, hmm
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad, make you never wanna leave

Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a—
I ain't trying to mess your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, **** the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got **** up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the *** shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

'Cause I just wanna look— (Hahaha)

(Woo)
'Cause I just wanna look

Now that I have captured your attention
I wanna steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA, I'm ready for inspection
Sh-sh-show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights
So you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long, baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end, hit rewind
All night long, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song
Yeah, baby, slow down the song

If you want me, I'm accepting applications
So long as we ke-keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out
So amazing

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow?
Break it down and drop it low, low
'Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights

Yeah, baby, slow down the song You love the way i feel up on you
Just want a little touch up on me
'Cuz you know i'm a bit wrecked Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evening
Let a couple years water down how I'm feeling about you
(Feeling about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me)

What was there wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you

Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

Hold on, take a minute, love
I ain't trying to mess your business up
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got **** up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the *** shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

You can take me here, here
Take me there, there
Take me wherever you like

They fell in love one summer
A little too wild for each other
Shiny 'til it wasn't
Feels good 'til it doesn't
It was her first real lover
His too 'til he had another
Oh, God, when she found out
Trust levels went way down

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Look at her now, watch her go
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Wow, look at her now

Wow, look at her now

Fast nights that got him
That new life was his problem
Not saying she was perfect
Still regrets that moment
Like that night
Wasn't wrong, wasn't right, yeah
What a thing to be human (What a thing to be human)
Made her more of a woman (Made her more of a woman)

Of course she was sad
But now she's glad she dodged a bullet (Mm)
Took a few years to soak up the tears
But look at her now, watch her go

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm

I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apartup boy
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love
Sick of that love
So sick of that love
So sick of that love

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
So sick of that love
So sick of that love
So sick of that love
So, so, so sick of that love
So sick of that love
So sick of that love Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I'm feelin' about you
(Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin' and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

I'll go back to you
I'll go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you, I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you)
(Go back to you, go back to you) What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby
The heart wants what it wants, baby When you're ready

         Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
'Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine
Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect
How does she touch you? can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

         Can't keep my hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
You're metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what it’s like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
You're metaphorical gin and juice

Cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

The doctors say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I

My hands to myself
And I'm trying, trying, I'm trying, but I
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, ""No one has to know what wе do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (burnin'), it (it), down (down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (follow), you (you), around
(Follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha Can't keep my hands to myself

I want it all, no, nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
(I want it all) Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to? (Oh)

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself (Yeah)
My hands to myself
Can't keep, keep my hands to myself
I want it all, no, nothing else
