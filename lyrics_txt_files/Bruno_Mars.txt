And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance

But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways

I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours

Take you to every party

Tell me why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
Ooh, when I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye

Yeah, I'm still in love with you darlin'
I know you feel the same
Oh, what's the point of both of us being broken-hearted?
I pray it's never too late

So tell me, why, why can't we try and start again?
This can't be how our story ends
You're more than my girl, you're my best friend
Tell me you remember when
I was your man and you were my girl
It was you and me against the world

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?

Girl won't you listen?

It's you that I'm missin'
(Don't you give up)
Take my hand, I wanna go, I wanna go
(All the way)
If we're gonna fight this fight for better days
I know we're gonna make it
This is the chance, let's take it

Baby, ain't nobody gonna love me like the way you do
(No, no, no, no)
And you ain't never gonna find a love like mine
(Oh, tell me)
Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?

Tell me what can I do to make it up to you?
'Cause what we got's too good to say goodbye, goodbye If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, ""There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
And pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain

Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby
And there'll be no clear skies
If I lose you, baby
And just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain It's a beautiful night

Rule two, do you to the fullest (To the fullest)
And never be ashamed to
You're just good at what they can't do
And they hate that, they wanna paint you
In they color, put you on another
But what they don't accept, and what they don't see
The best thing is what you already be

Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Uh yeah
The definition of real is
If you don't feel, then you don't you feel it
Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah I got too many girls on hold for you to be so bold
Too many on my team for you to act so mean
You say you wanna go and have fun, well you ain't the only one
If I ring, don't let it ring too long or I'm gone

On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name

Guess I've always been this way

You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do

I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Me and my guitar, tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna leave with more than what I got
'Cause 68 cent just ain't gonna pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

'Cause my job got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I would stand up to de cops
And stand up to de bigga heads
Becaw de whole ah de ah saps
All de talk dem a talk

Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow

Get messed up today

Riding to dangers where I'd always run
A boy who had his fun
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby (now baby) now baby (now baby)

Oh, oh, oh I, I know it breaks your heart
To picture the only one you want to love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby (now baby) now baby (now baby)

Oh baby, please, let's leave the past behind us
Behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me

Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd come Every day I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years passed and we're still here today
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life

Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me

As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life Oh yes

Well, looky here, looky here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thing ready for me to grab
But little does she know that I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night, it is her I'll be holding

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, ""Baby, baby, please don't go away...""
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Run, run, run away, run away, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, get away, get away, darlin'
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause Lord knows I'm a rollin' stone
So you better run, run, run away, run away, baby

Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies that I'd like to pursue
Now even though they eating out the palm of my hand
There's only one carrot and they all gotta share it

I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me, ""Baby, baby, please don't go away...""
But when I play, I never stay
So every girl that I meet, yeah, this is what I say

Never want to do this again
Wrong turn, on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must have been blind
Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma ooh

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, ""Please, please, please""
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail
(Yeah, that's what I'll do)
I'll be smiling in my cell
(Yeah, thinking 'bout you)
Can't nobody save you now
Sure there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma ooh

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run

I should've known better
(I should've known better)
Cause when we were together
(Cause when we were together)
She never said forever
(She never said forever)
I'm a fool that played in her game, hey!

Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
Cause you won't know what it's like until you try

You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you, try

You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side

You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side

It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand I've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again

Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win

Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change (oh)

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins

I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins Hello
You know you look even better
Than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips
You know, I start to feel wonderful
It's something incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you
And I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free

Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time

I know
I was with you last night, but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around
They notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time
Oh, moonshine, your loving makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time

We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

Oh, moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time
The last time

Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby

Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see

Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows

All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends

She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal (Oh)
A heart that can't feel (Oh), it's broken (Broken)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows, oh)
His love is all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (All she knows), all she knows (Damn)
His love is all she knows I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?

Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don’t have the same smile

Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?

Will you still want to dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears don’t hear so well and I can’t find the beat

Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy? She wakes up in the morning
Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion
While she is wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music on, but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club
The way she's showing to her reflection

Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep

Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you

I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day
(Little did I know)
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for

Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe

If she dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I gave it up
But I guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied

I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh Ooh

She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me but no

I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?

I saw something worth my future
So right, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong?

I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?

You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know

But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more

Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you

Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do
And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose

Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you

Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you
Oh, and now you know
And now you know

Girl, to tell you the truth

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah Oh 

When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh
He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend (Ah ah ah)

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh

So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh

There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me

How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't

Oh
Never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't All alone in my room
Waiting for, for this phone to ring

How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time
Taking roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there
But when, oh when will I learn to just put you first

I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
Can I move on
Oh

When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first

Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on

I get out of my own way, let you have your way
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. No

I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on Here I am again doing things I said that I wouldn't do
It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?

After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Because I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on

Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely

I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Oh babe
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you
(in love, in love, in love)
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
(in love, in love, in love)
Me & you, me & you, me & you
I think about you girl
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Got me thinking ’bout you
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love E-eh-eh-eh
You said that I was so not afraid
You said that I was just a 
But I'm not trying my best to owe it
You told me that I'm not to follow
And you only knew what you do, babe
If you only saw what I was
But I'm not trying to bet this only
Because you can't count my own deals on it
Oh I want to touch you with the lights on
Oh I want to freak you with the light-
My lonely girl you're my only girl
This is so not your fault
You're my only girl (Yeah) It's not a question of love
'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way

Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes

Some things we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good

Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes


Before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I don't know
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh

I don't know what it is what it is about you
But I can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Got to let you know that I'm meant to you
The later it gets I got to have you
Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh


12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
Tipsy with a girl who's not my type
But the late it gets it might be on tonight
Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh

Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah

Ooh oh

Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one?


Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one? Bruno Mars
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (huh)
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Bruno Mars & Cee-Lo Green
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand What are you fucking crazy?
Damn ...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I. ..
I do not wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost
I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
Should you have by now noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!
Chorus:
Girl, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost Intro (J. Reyez):
Alright, I do this for all of you
I make music for love, the love of everything
J. Reyez... Bruno Mars...
C'mon!
Verse 1 (J. Reyez):
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
The same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
That don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
You and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
Your eyes, the world I see in you
And time never goes to waste
Don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
This love, you can never rearrange
Everytime when I see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Verse 2 (J. Reyez):
Just the way you express with ""ing"" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
Your happiness is my essential
This a way for me to say thanks
No stress, I want you to give me strenght
When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
But to the world you're just one person
But to that person you mean the world is just
How we ride, me and my girl, uhh
We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
We fall together, we coincided
The way to my heart it was hard to find it
But you found dead deep down inside of this love
You can never rearrange
Everytime when i see your face
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are (x2)
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah-ahh Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing
Kook what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me ""Daddy, it's yours""
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, ""Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!""

Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa

For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long

All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls

Diamonds on my neck and I don't mean to brag
But I work hard for this money (hard hard for this money)
And in case you didn't hear me I work (hard for this money, money)
Checks in the mail everyday
That's why these boys be like (aye baby, aye baby)
Us girls we get it in, money just like them
Ladies holla if you feel me
Chorus:
Fresh out the mall in our brand new fits
Going ninety five in our brand new whips
Sayin (Ladies is pimps too) (3x)
Oh
Strut through the club yeah they know we so paid
Standin' on the table sippin' ace of spades
Sayin (Ladies is pimps too) (3x)
Oh
Verse:
Getcha own paper, got your own dimes
Buy your own drinks on your own grind
And put your hands up, up ,up
Ladies put your hands up, up , up
Gotcha own house, gotcha own car
And you don't need a man to know who you are
And put your hands up, up ,up
Ladies put your hands up, up , haa
Chorus:
Fresh out the mall in our brand new fits
Going ninety five in our brand new whips
Sayin (Ladies is pimps too) (3x)
Oh
Strut through the club yeah they know we so pay
Standin' on the table sippin' ace of spades
Sayin (Ladies is pimps too) (3x)
Oh Staring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
(But I'm stuck here alone)
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me

How do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window

I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you (I love you)
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me


How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always want to see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too

Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
(Window, window)
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
(You go, you go)
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window (the window)
The girl at the window I I I don't know why why
It seems like every other night
You pick a fight fight
I kind of know I do the the same
Be calling you out your name
This is not what lovers are supposed to do do
You tell me to go go
I start walking out out
When we both know know
What we're all about bout
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because of our love
But you and I both know we never giving up

Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around round round round
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down down down
Cause I know we can work it out, work it out, talk it out, talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around

Now wait wait before you say say
Something you know you'll take back later on today day
Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you bay
All I ask is that you always appreciate me
You tell me to go go
I start walking out out
When we both know know
What we're all about about
We fuss fight and scream
And it’s all because I love you
But you and I both know we never giving up


Aren’t nobody that can love me like you love me
That’s why I always turn around for you you you you you you you you
Aren’t nobody that can love me like you love me
That’s why i always turn around for you you you you you you you
Its only for you

Every time I try to leave something tells me to turn around
(Something tells me Something’s tells me)
Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down (the only one that hold me down)
Cause I know we can work it out, (oh) work it out, talk it out, (ooh) talk it out stick it out stick it out ooh ooh ooh
Every time I try to leave we find a way to figure it out
That’s why I always turn around Maybe if I jump or spread my wings
I know I've been wrong about these things
I don't care if no one else believes
I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight

Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another because she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
you can achieve if you do believe
Got to chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end


Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Year’s Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast
Trying to hang on passenger
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live got to be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my Bella I don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me

I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run

Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me


You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shut up and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created
Yeah
Killer on the run run run run run run run run

Killer on the run 

Goodbye It's your boy Bruno
I’m going to take you to the top girl, hey
Top of the world. You ready?
Come on (let's go)

I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feeling
So long my feet have been up off the floor
Destiny is what I call it
My Heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh

Till the day that I stop living
Girl my love I won't stop giving
Cross my heart and hope to die my love is yours
And I pray girl that this feeling
Is something that we always feeling
If you're with it girl, hear me girl
This is what I'll do

I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I aren’t never felt this way before

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours
Ha ooh it feels so good baby yeah

And to me you're like a flower
It's a blessing every hour
And I get to spend this time with you
And I won't take you for granted next to you is where I'm standing
Girl you're a dream come true


I will give you the world
Put it in your hands
Cause I aren’t never felt this way before (cause I aren’t never felt this way before)

On top of the world
Is where we'll stand (where we'll stand girl)
You just say the word and girl it's yours (the word and girl its yours)

Just take my hand ooh
We can float to the sky, baby just you and I
Never let you go
Just take my hand
So many things I want to show you girl
While we're on top of the world


On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours (you just say the word and girl its yours)


On top of the world
Is where we'll stand
You just say the word and girl it's yours

It's all for you girl
It's all for you
Let's go I feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh

I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night

Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again



Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Ooh Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like
You won't come through
Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Round and r-r-r-round we go 
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles c-circles
Please girl!

I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough (for us)
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?
(Baby tell me what you want) A little more time
(Baby tell me what you need) Baby all your love
(How far you trying to go?) All the way
(Girl I just don't know) Make up your mind You use to tell that you loved me
Yeah that's what you would say
You use to buy flowers even out on valentine’s day
You would surprise me with a dinner even though you just ate
But what happened? Baby, what happened?

We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before?
Whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh, whoa oh

You use to look me in my eye but now you just look away
If I pull some extra time you say that you just can't stay
Oh, if you leave me at home alone for just one more night
I promise, it's going to be the last time

We've been through some changes
Like we in different places
And now you think that you can just do what you do
Without any consequences
It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger, a stranger
And I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before? whoa

What you want me to do (do)
I'm not gun' chase after you (you)
Tell me how can I get (get)
Back the man I first met (met)

It's not what you say but what you don't say
It's not what you do but what you don't do
It's not where we go but where we don't go
It's like I don't even know you anymore
You're just a stranger (don't know you no more)
A stranger and I don't recognize you no more
You're just a stranger, a stranger
What happened to the man that you were before? 1, 2, 3 oh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby aren’t scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go

Oh no
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm going to take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare

He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go


Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love


You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come true We had a date, I stood you up
You tried to call, but I didn't pick up
See I forgot about our plans, please forgive me for ruining your night so many times

I'm sorry, I know you're mad
And I don't want to be like every other man that you had
So I'm stopping all the childish things
Girl, you mean too much to me
Your love is worth too much to lose

Girl, I know I broke your heart
Trusting me is really hard
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today

I'm tired of playing
The kiss and make-up game
And I apologize for the man I became
If I could do it all again
I would have helped my best friend
And I would throw away all my selfish ways


I know that I'm the one to blame
You say every man's the same
But watch how quick I change my ways
Starting today (today)
Starting today (today)
Girl, I'm starting today She got it, she looking good
I'm just watching her move
She walks on in with her red dress on
Her lips as bright as the sun
Her curves goes every which way
Got skin like porcelain
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
(Are you talking to me?)
The way her hair falls down her back
Billy accents her tattoo?
Her legs like a supermodel
She worn for them high heel shoes
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it
(Get it)
Just watch her move
She pulls me to the side
Tells me she wants to go
I say, girl, I'm yours tonight
After this I'm taking you home
First and for most I dance with you
Get you in the mood
Maybe later, baby
Girl, I'll show you exactly how I do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
She got every single guy in the club
Just watching her move
And she don't wanna dance with anyone
Let her do what she do
Just watch her get it

Watch her move, ooh Look at her shinin'
Her feathers they glow
Now the jungle's smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?
The day has come at last
Our precious jewel has returned
I'll be the first to say welcome back
Oh welcome back
I say welcome, welcome, welcome
Back I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl that girl
Every time I came around
She made her body go down
Her physical was so crazy
She could make a blind man see
Ooh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl
That girl, that girl
I must've seen her beauty at the bar
Under the strobe lights, looking like a star
(Looking like a star, girl)
But everyone started rushing me
Looking through the crowd, shawty left the scene, oh
Before then, we got separated
She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
If I gotta almost search the whole club
Trying to get to her before she sobers up
Let me see you throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? Where did she go?
I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Club closing up, I'm still looking for you
Walked up to the ladies room
No luck, so I'm headed to the DJ booth
Next thing I know
She tell my show, ""This ain't you
Looking at you, you wanna take me home
So tonight, I just might put you on""
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl, that girl
I'm looking for the girl, I'm looking for the girl
I'm looking for the girl, that girl that girl
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night
Where did she go? Where did she go?
Where did she go? I've been looking for her all night If i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad (no no no)
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking ""maybe I should get it out""
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothing on you, baby (N-n-n-nothing on you baby, n-nothing on you) Hello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that I’m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Oh-ooh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Oh moonshine
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby

A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't I just stay here?
Spend the rest of my days here?
'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of heaven
For too long
For too long
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!)
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Oooh!) Oooohhhhhhh
Oooooohhhhhh

I used to go out of my mind
Tryna' redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take hold, cause you had me
Stuck in the middle of nowhere

And my faith, it would shake
I know you're trying your best
To take me

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
(Instrumental break)

You used to be
The man of my dreams
Only now it seems
You were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine
Told me ""Open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there""

I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night, I no longer see your face

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

Oooooooohhh
From ashes to ashes
And dust to us
Oooooohhhhhh
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya

Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long

Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long The best things in live are free
You can give it to the bears and bees
I want some money
That's what I want
I want some money
That's what I want
That's what I want
That's what I want!

Is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name 'Where Your Stacks At?'
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!
Pre Chorus (Inno Thakid)
Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like, (dat..) hey!
Pre Chorus (Inno Thakid)
Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch her....
Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...
(Inno Thakid)
As soon as I walked up in, I need some oxygen
First thing I noticed is shorty's been doing squats again
So bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses
We're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering
She don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them
They pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins
She's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild
The music gets her to dance, but the money makes her smile

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got...)
Money, money, money make her smile Bruno:
My baby so beautiful id take her to the stars she’s my baby she’s my baby
Uzi:
Me and Bruno bout to go to Mars im finna take my baby Past the stars “Count On Me”
If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I’ll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can’t see
I’ll be the light to guide you
We find out what we’re made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I’ll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You’ll be there
’Cause that’s what friends are supposed to do
If you’re tossin’ and you’re turnin’
And you just can’t fall asleep
I’ll sing a song bеside you
And if you ever forgеt how much you really mean to me
Every day I will remind you
We find out what we’re made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I’ll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you
