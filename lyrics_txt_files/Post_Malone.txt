Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before Hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on

I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home I've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done

To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more

To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh Never know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got ""Malone"" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'

Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace

(Ayy) Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again

Tell me why I can get no relief (I can't even sleep)
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace Ahahah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

I'ma pull up in a Bentley
With a fuckin' hunnid thousand in my pocket, yeah, yeah
I'ma pull in, swang my door open

So you know that I'm never ever coming back

I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah
I was an idiot
Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now, yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy

Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road

When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name

Beggin' on my knees on to the floor (To the floor)
Now I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now
It's over now
(It's over now) Oh

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?

You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?

Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied) Ooh-ooh, wow

Hago lo que quiera
Compro lo que quiera porque soy un rockstar
Voy pa'l avión privado
En el Ferrari, en el tablero ""180"" (180)
Voy de camino a Suiza
Pa' lanzar mi propio Hublot a la venta
Y voy llamando al Russo
Porque quiero gastarme un millón en prenda'

Una Panamera, un F12 frente a casa (Wuh)
Gucci, Ferragamo, compro todo plaza (Ajá)
Rhino pa' los corta', ratas que te cazan
Miles de hipócrita' que vienen y te abrazan
Yeh, yeh, vivo la vida como un rey (Rra)
Kilos de música de Medellín a Monterrey (Rey)
Siempre cruzando todos los límites de la ley (Ley)
Mi movie siempre está en play, yey (Play, yey)
Vivo la vida como un rockstar
Los que tiraron ya no existen, obvio no están
Tengo brujas que con los palos te acuestan
Con peine doble llenos que se manifiestan (Wuh)
Dicen que el dinero el alma me consume
Yo sigo celebrando en un jet por las nubes
Nadie me las daba cuando abajo solo estuve
Ahora la cuenta nunca declina, siempre sube
Siempre sube, siempre sube, siempre (Wuh)

'Tá bien, ustedes son los que más tienen
Vamos pa' los números y verán que son mis nenes
Lo que yo me compro no es pa' frontearle' a ustedes
Es pa' yo llevarme a su mujer en la Mercedes
Maybach, G Wagon, la llevo al privado
30 mil de altura, de camino a Colorado
Le regalo un AP en oro rosado
Me dice que le gusta en el avión si se lo hago
Pregúntale a tu patrón que sabe lo que haremo'

Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, ""Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix""
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi
T-Pain, Post Malone, Joey Bad, this is godly

Well, it ain't no use in turning off your light, babe
The one that I never knowed
Well, it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Well, I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
Like you've never done before
Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe
I can’t hear you anymore

I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

Well, so long, honey babe
Where I’m bound, I cannot tell
Well, goodbye's too good a word, babe
So, I’ll just say fare thee well
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind
You could have done better but, hey, I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But, don’t think twice, that’s all right

But, don't think twice, that's all right
Well, don't think twice, that's all right Oooh, I fall apart

Seems like the kids these days are all just lookin' to get higher, oh

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothin' wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

I got my woman, got my high, my guitar, and some money
And I'll be goddamned if these fuckers try to take that from me
But ain't shit wrong with us and don't tell me, ""Talk to somebody""
I'm drunk at 2 p.m., treat every day like it's a Friday

Want it all and we want it now
Do anything to not come down
Get my fix someway, somehow, today

You know, you know just how it goes
We're just stoned, leave us alone
Ain't nothing wrong, it's cool at home
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

We're good as gold, we're all just stoned
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned

You know, you know, just how it goes

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Stoned)
Ooh-ooh (Hey-oh-oh-oh), ooh-ooh
We're good as gold, we're all just stoned Las Vegas, sorcerers and sages
And the lights turn, turn dark like pages
And Manhattan, demons and dragons
I'm up in the air, where anything can happen
And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me


Seattle, where all the people battle
If the rain pours and bodies wash upon the shore
And Jackson, I walk around without a soul
I lost myself in the museum of rock & roll
And the city, us and the others
And the city, us and the others

Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me


Eldorado, city made of solid gold
Doesn't matter to you all that I left home
I know I've been gone for a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while
For a while

Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh you know when I am gone
All the places I can go
All the people I will meet
Oo-oo-oh
That don't feel like home to me
Oo-oo-oh I can do this on my own
And oo-oo-oo-oh it's been a while since I've been gone
All the places I have been
All the people I have met
Oo-oo-oh
I find myself back home again
Oo-oo-oh I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night free
(I do)

I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night free


I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No, I can't see you every night...
Free

I do
I do
I do
I do A-this thing (This thing)
I called love (I called love)
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get 'round to it, I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
A-this thing
I called love
It cries
In a cradle all night
It swings
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish, woo, I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock 'n' roll (Rock 'n' roll)
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool (Be cool)
Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby (Baby)
She knows how to rock 'n' roll
She drives me crazy (Crazy)
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat

I gotta be cool (Be cool)
Relax (Relax)
Get hip (Get hip)
And get on my tracks
Take a back seat (Back seat)
Hitch-hike (Hitch-hike)
And take a long ride on my motorbike until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love, crazy little thing called love Lyrics from Snippet

...For it too
I caught a lil' band for it too
And I'm like, ""Fuck yeah, I do""
I put 'em up..

Do you got the drug?
I said, ""Fuck yeah, I do""
They say...

I caught a lil' band for it too
And I'm like...

Fuck you all night
Do it just right
Give it Monkey see, monkey do (I don't know why)
Rather be dead than cool (I don't know why)
Every line ends in rhyme (I don't know why)
Less is more, love is blind (I don't know why)

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Give an inch, take a smile (I don't know why)

Blow it out, keep it in (I don't know why)

Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah! Let's tell it to rooftops that we have got something new
Let's tell it to rooftops that you have me and I have you
Let's tell it to rooftops, Let's tell it to rooftops
Let's tell it to rooftops

Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home
Then you looked at me and said I want to be like that
When we're old, when we're old
When we're old
Looking at picture frames with thought of dancers and home
Then you looked at me and said I want to be like that
When we're old, when we're old
When we're old

Let's tell it to rooftops, Let's tell it to rooftops
Let's tell it to rooftops

We don't have time to do all the things that we need
Then you looked at me and said I'll be gone in a week
In a week, in a week
In a week
We don't have time to do all the things that we need
Then you looked at me and said I'll be gone in a week
In a week, in a week
In a week

Let's tell it to rooftops that we have got something new

As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

Memoria

Memoria
Memoria I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I lost all my friends, damn, I had to learn the hard way
Started from the bottom, damn right, we came a long way
Talk down on my name, yeah, they try to take it all away
Never had it easy, no, they always made it hard for me
Never gave me shit, had to get my own grip
I ain't perfect, I admit
I kept going, never quit
I provided for my fam, I made sure my dog's ate
Told my shawty 'Bae, I love you, I fuck with you the long way'

I don't need no friends, I'm countin' bands in this new Chanel
Who gon' stick around to the end? Only time will tell
Tried to shoot me down, dig a hole for my funeral
'Said I fall off, little bitch, you delusional

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
Can't apologize, nah, bitch, it ain't no excuse
Where were you when I was down bad, wouldn't give me nothing
People only seem to come around when they need something
You left me in the storm by myself, I was all alone
Diamond cross necklace, hope it only ain't good to my soul
Homies got the judge and got me feeling like 2Pac
I heard that's what you gotta go do when you're this sad

I don't need no friends, countin' bands in these YSL's
Throw a couple racks at little shawty 'cause she bad as hell
Diamond audemar on my wrist, it's a two tone
Wait a minute, hold up, who is this? This a new phone

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed
We could plant a house, we could build a tree
I don't even care, we could have all three
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said
She said, she said

I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, care if it's old
I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, mind, don't have a mind
Get away, get away, get away
Get away, away, away from your home
I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid
I'm afraid, afraid, ghost

Even if you have, even if you need
I don't mean to stare, we don't have to breed

Said... good It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

In her false witness hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad


It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to know that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad One baby to another says, ""I'm lucky to have met you""
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

You, you, you
You, you, you

One baby to another says, ""I'm lucky to have met you""
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins
I like you I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

If you ever need anything please don't

I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel and I
Wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you

And I've got this friend, you see who makes me feel
And I wanted more than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We'll make a pact to learn from who
Ever we want without new rules
And we'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way to prove they still
Smell her on you
They still smell her on you
Smell her on you Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass

He's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means

And I say he's the one who likes all our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say yeah

I got so high, I scratched till I bled
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you
Know it's wrong so what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck
Won't you believe it? It's just my luck

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait

Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!

Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait!
Gotta find a way, find a way, when I'm there!
Gotta find a way! Aah! Aah!
Yeah! Lyrics from snippet

... a red bone
I made the room feel like a...

What you know about wakin' up?
In the morning you gon' have to leave
All alone in my messy sheets
Ain't no breakfast"
