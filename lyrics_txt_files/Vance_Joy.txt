"I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Here's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, oh-o-oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
You're gonna sing the words wrong Talking like we used to do
It was always me and you
Shaping up and shipping out
Check me in and check me out
Do you like walking in the rain?
When you think of love, do you think of pain?
You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe

Well, hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well, hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Ah, ooh
Your mess is mine

See you in the marketplace
Walkin 'round at 8:00am
I got two hours before my flight
Luck, be on my side tonight
You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all that time
Well, did I give enough of mine?

Well, hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well, hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Ooh, ah, ah
Your mess is mine
Your mess is mine

Bring me to your house
Tell me, ""Sorry for the mess"", hey, I don't mind
You're talking in your sleep, out of time
Well, you still make sense to me, your mess is mine
Ah, ooh

Your mess is mine
This body is yours and this body is mine
Ooh, ooh
Your mess is mine
Your mess is mine She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""

And I
And I

Lips generous and warm
You build me up like stairs
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be?

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up

And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its weight
Well, now you've come and gone
I've finally worked it out, I worked it out

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh I saw you standing there
Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said ""Baby, this rain changes everything""
And my heart ran away from me

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Opening up can open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
Darling, I do
I'm with you

There's nothing I won't do to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line
And it's high time that you love me
'Cause you do it so well to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line
And it's high, high time

Oh darling, I'm with you
Oh darling, I'm with you
There's nothing I won't do
There's nothing I won't do
I'm with you
Darling, I'm with you I was only walking through your neighbourhood
Saw your light on, honey, in the cold I stood
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
I've been getting used to waking up with you
I've been getting used to waking up here
Anywhere I go, there you are
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm

You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh, ooh

Since we met, I feel a lightness in my step
You're miles away, but I still feel you
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
Late at night, when you can't fall asleep
I'll be lying right beside you, counting sheep
Anywhere I go, there you are (Anywhere)
Anywhere I go, there you are
There you are, there you are, mm

You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood

""Now, listen here,"" she said
""Boy, when you know, you'll know""
And I know

You're the fire and the flood
And I always feel you in my blood
Everything is fine
When your head's resting next to mine, next to mine
You're the fire and the flood I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now Time to let it go
It won't let go of me
Hanging by a thread
Cutting the cord and then falling back into the
Black 'cause if I don't
If I wait 'til it feels right
I'll be waiting my whole life
Closing my eyes, remember how we were like

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history
O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history

I have a memory
You're visiting me at night
Climbing in my bed
You were so quiet that you never woke me
I love the way you could
See the good in everything
But, do we fuel the fire?
Closing my eyes, remember how we were like

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

Started with a word
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to
Read between the lines
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to

O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history
O-o-o-o-o-o
O-o-o-o-o
That's the way it was
But that's history

Well, I got a feeling
Darling, it's possible
'Cause love's got no ceiling
Now, that it's just so strong
And I got a feeling
Like everything is possible
I'm trying to change
M-m-m-m-m

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
That's the history
Blue, how we used to roar
Like an open fire
That's the way it was
But that's history

Started with a word
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
It's there on our faces for anyone willing to
Read between the lines
Now, look at where we are
Everything we've done
Started out with just one

O-o-o-o-o-o

Gold, when you see me
Hi, if you need me
Babe, that's the way it was
But that's history Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost

So tired of sleepin' alone
So tired of eatin' alone
I need to ask her what's goin' on
Are we goin' strong?
She felt like resting her head
My shoulder was the perfect height
We fit so right, so what's goin' on?
'Cause I've been undone
The long drive, the coastline
Lookin' out at first light
Am I still on her mind?
I've been undone

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba

And still the memory's right there
She put the breeze in my hair
No kiss was softer, softer than this
I'm readin' her lips, oh
Each line I read
She left her books in my bed
And her song in my head
I've been undone

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ever lost

Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba

Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Out on the West Coast
I gotta get back, I can't let this go
Oh, Saturday Sun
I met someone
Don't care what it costs
No ray of sunlight's ever lost
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Oh, Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
Lost, oh Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba
I met someone
Oh, Saturday Sun
Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba

Ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-b-ba-ba I love you in the morning when the blood runs to your cheeks
Babe, you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see
I was just a boy striking matches upon your heart
I couldn't get no sparks
Ask me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor
Standing at the edge, I feel like I been here before
Loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light
If it don't feel right, babe

You can run and hide, babe
Like a bird, you can take flight
If I've been holding on too tight
If I've been holding on
Mmm, oooh
Oooh, oooh, ooooh

Your mother always told us we should go out to the dance
You can't get struck by lightning if you're not standing in the rain
Take it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt
If it don't work out
You were in the shower we were talking through the glass
Packing up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself
One day you were smiling
I could tell by how you sounded on the phone
You said ""I'm coming home, babe""

I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
I'm thinking 'bout coming home
Mmm
I'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe
Mmm
I'm thinking 'bout coming home Under the surface you don't know what you'll find
Hmm, until it's your time
No second chances but all we can do is try
Hmm, I made up my mind

I can't see you
But I hear your call
Baby, hold on now

We're going home
If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine

Some things are simple and hard to ignore
They say, hmm, the truth is like that
We're getting colder, so far from the shore
I say, hmm, the world is like that

I can't see you
But I hear your call
Baby, hold on now

We're going home
If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine

There's a place that I
Wanna run with you
Darling, there's a place that I
Wanna run with you

We're going home
If we make it or we don't, we won't be alone
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
If you're waiting all your life, you won't ever go
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know I'm home
When I see your light shine, I know
I'm home
I'm home
When I see your light shine You told me, ""Boy, look the other way""
You told me, ""Boy, bite your tongue""
Yes, that's not the way
Yeah, that's not the way
Ah, that's just not the way that friends behave
Ah, that's just not the way that friends behave
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar

You told me, ""Boy, look the other way""
You told me, ""Boy, hide those hands""
Well, I've been living on the crumbs of your love
And I'm starving now
And that is just the way that we remain
Oh, that will be the way that we remain
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar
You lined me up across the room
Two falling sparks, one willing fool
And I, I always knew
That I would love you from afar

It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
She got darling hazel eyes
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now
It shouldn't come as a surprise
What I'm feeling, what I'm feeling now There's an ocean inside my head
Waves that don't ever rest
This kind of beauty ain't ordinary
You look, but do you really see?

Won't you take your time on me?
'Cause we got nowhere else to be

We'll go dancing in the kitchen
You fall in my arms
Baby won't you let your phone keep ringing
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Won't you take your time on me?
Oh, oh, oh
On me
Oh, oh

I'll let you figure me out
Tear all my fences down
We've been so tired
Asleep on our feet
Chasing things we'll never keep

Won't you take your time on me?
'Cause we got nowhere else to be

We'll go dancing in the kitchen
You fall in my arms
Baby won't you let your phone keep ringing
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
We could walk away with nothing
We could go too far
I'll admit I never saw you coming
Now I see your colors running
Won't you take your time on me?
Won't you take your time on me?
Oh, oh, oh
On me
Oh, oh

And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me)
And you know my heart, well it's waiting for your call
(Take your time on me) Why, why do you go wasting your time on me?
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much that’s left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
And why, why do you go flashing those eyes at me?
You know that I'm eager to please
I’ve always been eager to please
Oh yeah, babe

But I've, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you’ve got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days

Oh, why?
Oh, why?
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well, I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans

Why, why do you go wasting your youth on me?
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much time left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
Why? We look at the faces on your bedroom wall
Nobody’s perfect at all
Well, sometimes it makes you feel small
Oh yeah, babe

Well, I've, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you've got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days

Oh, why?
Oh, why?
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well, I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans

The things that I thought would last
Well, they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
Well, they’re changing, they’re changing
The things that I thought would last
Well, they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
They’re changing, they’re changing, they're changing now

They’re changing, they're changing now
They’re changing, they're changing now Walk in the front door, drop my keys
Take my shoes off and go
Straight into your arms; keep me safe
And I don't feel like myself
I been waiting to go
Straight into your arms; keep me safe

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your arms

You keep me on track
I can't sleep 'til you come back home to me
Into my arms, baby
So let's make the best of what we have
Time is precious; it won't last
I see you and I get back

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your arms

And I've been waiting, I'm waiting
My heart is calling, it's calling

Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms
Ooh, I've been gone since yesterday
And I fell straight, straight into your arms
Ooh, but it only takes one day
And I run straight, straight into your arms
Straight into your arms, straight into your arms I saw you smile
I knew you had spirit
Oh won't you let your colors run
And isn't it odd, the way we try to tell ourselves we got limits
You're beautiful, but you just don't see it sometimes
And I don't know why

Oh, you're the shape of my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
When I fall, I'm fine
All I wanted was your time
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone, alone with me

I'll sit right here, till you start talking
I'll wait it out till you come 'round
It pays to look up in the big city
Everything moves so fast
It pays to look up
'Cause you don't know what you might see
When you look around

Oh, you're the shape of my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When we're alone

Here I am, saying things to you
I never thought that I'd I would say outside my head
Oh, and here we are
I'm doing things with you I never thought we'd do
I'm seeing into you

Oh, you're the shape of all my days
Oh, you're my holy place
And I know

Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone with me
When I fall, I'm fine
All I wanted was your time
Everything's good
Everything's just as it should be
When you're alone, alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me
You're alone with me, babe
You're alone with me She don’t like small places
Give her highways and by-ways
And don’t get stuck in her head
And it’s been so long
And I will read into everything you don’t say
All of your silent ways

I’m a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar, you see what the name is
Think that it’s worth it? Well, I hope that you’re right
You’re falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you’re looking well
Won’t you come through my door asking, ""How was your day?""?
And you know that I’m still a dog
And I’m trusting my nose, will it show me the way?

I’m glad that you’re still here
Won’t you hold up a candle?
I’m stumbling in the dark
And when I needed hope
I remind myself that at least I got one thing right
It'll always be right

I’m a dog lying down on a warm bit of pavement
Checking this collar, you see what the name is
Think that it’s worth it? Well, I hope that you’re right
You’re falling asleep on the red eye tonight

And you know that you’re looking well
Won’t you come through my door asking, ""How was your day?""?
Well, you know that I’m still a dog
And I’m trusting my nose, will it show me the way?

Won’t you get out while you can?
Won’t you cover your eyes if you’re tired of seeing?
Won’t you get out while you can?
And try saving yourself

Can we talk in the morning?
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Oh, baby, it’s late
Can we talk in the morning?
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Oh, baby, it's late
Baby, it's late
(Tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when)
Ooh
(Tell me, tell me when, tell me when
Tell me) Come over to my house,  jump in the neighbour's pool
It felt nice, felt so nice
And it was getting dark, you wrapped your long legs
Around me, I held on tight
Lying in my bed, the unfamiliar sheets
Were so cool on your skin
When your daddy called, said you were at a friend's
And we walked the long way home

Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest

Breathe me with your hands, show me a safe place
And I'll come down, yeah, I'll come down
And can you recognise the look upon my face?
It's on my lips, it's in my eyes
This bar will never break, won't you say it one more time?
Won't you say my name? Won't you say my name?
This bar will never break, won't you say it one more time?
Won't you say, say my name?

Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest

Ooh-oh, da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, ooh-oh
Da, da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da
Da, da-da-da
(Ooh, ooh)

Going on my first impression, I recall you wearing white
There was something sweet in the air, babe, that summer night
There will always be another time for us to fall in love
But it never cuts you quite as deep as that first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time

First times always cut the deepest, the first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest, the first time
You'll find out that the deepest cut is the first time
First times always cut the deepest You were the one to visit my darkness
You were the brightest way
You dropped a stone into the well
We'd wait for the sound it made
When it got quiet, you could hear your heart
Tell me, what did it say?
I was a bird, you opened the cage
It felt like a clean white page

You came along
You light up my days, my personal sun
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash


You came along
You light up my days, my personal sun
Showing me all the ways I could fall
You made me feel new
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash
I'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you
Baby, feel me crash You think you're ready
But you've got too much on your mind
Too much left to prove
No easy answers
You've got to work it out yourself
You won't hear anyone but you

The moment you stop looking
Wherever you go, you'll be in the right place
You'll never know the difference it makes
When you let go, and give up your chance
I'll come find you one of these days

We've got potential
But it's the future you and me
When the coast is cleared
You see the sunrise
I see your soul shine through to your eyes
When you're here

The moment you stop looking
Wherever you go, you'll be in the right place
You'll never know the difference it makes
When you let go, and give up your chance
I'll come find you one of these days


The moment you stop looking
Yeah, the moment you stop looking
Wherever you go, you'll be in the right place
You'll never know the difference it makes
When you let go, and give up your chance
I'll come find you one of these days
I'll come find you one of these days
I'll come find you one of these days Oh, if you're losing sleep
Oh, if you're losing sleep, scared of shadows
Oh, see it's just a chair, see the clothes hang there
Oh, don't go losing sleep, scared of shadows

Oh, don't feel bad
I never have
Since I got you
My Emmylou

You wear your socks to bed
You wear your socks to bed, that's what I do
Oh, come on, sleepyhead, get yourself to bed
Don't go losin' all the nighttime

Oh, don't feel bad
I never have
Since I got you
My Emmylou

You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved
You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved

Oh, don't feel bad
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
I never have
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
Since I've got you
(You are loved, you are loved, you are loved, you are loved)
Oh, now, my Emmylou We came out of the cinema
We were rubbing our eyes
Our mouths were dry from the sugar and the popcorn
And we felt a little guilty
About spending that whole sunny day inside
The movie we were watching
About Bonnie and Clyde
They were driving down a backroad
They thought they were home free
The police knew they were coming
They were hiding in the trees
And they shot them down
One hundred and thirty rounds
They shot them down

So we might as well say
What's on our minds
'Cause there's no way to know
When it's your time to go
When it's your time to go

Later we were walking on the streets of Monterey
The trees beside the water
Reminded you of childhood holidays
Hey babe, I know the way
To a little stretch of beach
Where we could lose ourselves

Don't matter where you've been
You jump into the water and you come out clean
Don't matter where you've been
You jump into this water and you come out clean

So we might as well say
What's on our minds
'Cause there's no way to know
When it's your time to go
When it's your time to go
There's no way to know

Don't matter where you've been
You jump into the water and you come out clean
Don't matter where you've been
You jump into this water and you come out clean I was only ten years old
Like the back of my hand knew the roads
I swerved my bike and lost control
Over the handles in the air
A lady who came walking by found me lying there
And the nurse at the hospital said

""Little boy, don't be scared
Now your father is waiting in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now your mom's on her way, you'll be out of here soon""

We drove so slowly through these streets
In the suburbs of our dreams
At night my father closed his eyes
He saw the new car in the drive
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
And the voice I can hear in my head

""Little boy, don't be scared
Now you know we'll be sleeping in the next room
Little boy, don't be sad
Now tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon""

We only need a little space
Just somewhere we could call our place
My mother standing in the doorway
Friday night, a smile on her face
These things always start so small
With no applause and no drum roll
And I came running up the hallway
See the car turn in the driveway

And I'll always be that little boy
And I've always been that little boy
Yeah, I'll always be that little boy
And I'll always be that little boy Don't walk too proud, don't talk too loud
And make it up as you go
And take whatever you are given
And leave what you think you know at the door

As she said
You could be my kind of man
And will you do the best you can?
And I could use a little time
I need to straighten out my mind
And I'm gonna break on, break on through
And I close my eyes and think of you

And you said
You could be my kind of man
And will you do the best you can?
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand

You could be my, you could be my
You could be my kind of man
You could be my, you could be my
You could be my kind of man

Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing that you love
Find a thing you understand
Find a thing you understand Storm rolled in to our surprise
It doesn't rain under the tall trees
You were my lover, you were my tree
You would always protect me
It's easier to take a heart than to let your own be taken
I love that little smile you keep in the corner of your mouth

And is it hard to see me go?
Doing things the wrong way
If you're here, when I fall
I know that I won't fall a long way
A long way

We were talking on the phone
I stepped out into the hallway
My face was frozen on the screen
And you started laughing
Put a comb through your hair
And a clean shirt on
There's people coming 'round here soon
Everyone, act normal

Big trees fall all the time
They crack and sound like lightning
Leave a big space in your sky when they fall
When they fall a long way
A long way

Pick me up
Fill my cup now
Take me down, down to where we start
Let's go too far now
All tangled up
Take me down, down to where we start
Down to where we start
Where we start Coming to your house, knocking at your door
You're my first sip of wine, you cool me, cool me down

Do you know me, you know me, you know me, do you know me now?
Do you love me, you love me, you love me, do you love me now?
Oh

Left your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away

Now I'm in the dark, I'm not so used to doubt
You're my first cigarette, cause you calm me, you calm me down

Do you love me, you love me, you love me, do you love me now?
Do you feel me, you feel me, you feel me, do you feel me now?
Oh

Left your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away
The kid you used to be
But I know that you're still there
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away

Why'd I let you go? Why'd I let you go?
Why'd I let you go? Why?
Why'd I let you go? Why'd I let you go?
Why'd I let you go? Why?

Your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away
The kid you used to be
But I know that you're still there
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away

Left your clothes next to the bed
Some pretty pictures in my head
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away
The kid you used to be
Well, I know that you're still there
I hope you had a great summer, a great summer away Waiting for you, baby, through the coldest days
Huddled in the backseat of the van
And I know a girl who would wait until it's dark
When she sings, the heavens part
They part, ooh, ooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming out
And I must have cried
When I held those hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know what I mean?

And baby, don't you know that I love your snaggletooth?
I see it poking when you laugh
And baby, don't you know that I love those pigeon toes?
I hope that you get these pigeon lungs
Lungs, ooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming up
And I must have cried
When I held your hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know what I mean?

And I will try my best
To take this big old hen
And I will know his name
And always feel the same
And all lit up so bright
In the orange glow
And all lit up so bright
In the orange glow
Glow, oooh

And I held my ground
When I heard those sounds
Coming out
And I must have cried
When I held those hands
So, do you know what I mean?
So, do you know how I feel?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know? Do you know?
So, do you know what I mean? Hold me up to the light
Tell me if the sun comes shining through
And I got this heaviness in my chest
Since your love came breaking through

And I wanna know where it's coming from
Where this is coming from, where this is coming from
And I wanna know what you're running from
What are you running from?

Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?

Lay my dreams down at your feet
Baby, watch out where you step
And there's no need for us
Knowing all the answers yet

And I wanna know what you're running from
What are you running from? What are you running from?
And I wanna know where it's coming from
Where this is coming from

Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?

You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I never know how close I came
You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I never know how close
You're back for a minute and you're gone
And I'll never know how

Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I, who am I
Without you, without you?
Who am I? Think you're in control until you're not
And you're so in love until you're not
Find a place where we can be alone
Find a place where we can be ourselves
So aim high and aim true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling

Like a feather falling past your cheek
Feel the breath of heaven on your face
We all die trying to get it right
We're all gonna die trying to get it right
So aim high and aim true

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah
Oh, I'm falling

Aim true
Won't you aim true?
Aim true
Won't you aim true? I miss you more than you could know
I watch the grass on the back lawn grow
And I will not allow the winds of change to blow
And I hope you decide to come back home

'Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
'Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love

You reach out for me in the night
And an errant finger pokes me in the eye
And I leave your contact lenses on the bedside table
And I'm hoping you decide to come back home

'Cause this heavy heart, oh, how it's yearned
'Cause I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love

Oh, you went running with my heart
And it's a long, long, long way back
And this right here, well, it just ain't living
Oh, I want you to come back

Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
Well, I've been alone far too long
When are you coming home, my love?
My love Say I don't look much like a lover
Doesn't mean that I won't try
To set your world on fire every once in a while
We lie on the kitchen floor
Hot air rises and it's going to be hot as hell here soon
We're gonna need some relief

Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said
Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said

Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying

You can keep moving on like you do
The road goes as far as the eye can see
I won't stand in your way, what's the good in that?
And the flowers in their bed
They're drooping and dying and fading away
This weather's no good for growing things

Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said
Sick of leaving things half-done, leaving things half-said

Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can

Will you keep moving on like you do?
Will you keep moving on?
So, will you keep moving you on like you do?

Oh, I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can
I am, I am trying
The best that I can I was born on a Saturday
My dad, he held me screaming in his arms
And he can talk like it was yesterday
When I got that holy water in my eye
It's alright, is it just alright?

See all those faces coming down
I'm trying not to let them down this time
Babe, is that alright?
Well, I can still see the sun on the water
I can still feel your sunlight

And all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time

And I know that I come on strong
Forgive me, I just couldn't help myself
And I have changed, but I'm better now
And I see you in this new and perfect light
You're so fine, you're oh so fine

See all those faces coming down
I'm trying not to let them down this time
Babe, is that alright?
Well, I can still see the sun on the water
I can still feel your sunlight

And all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time

Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

You know that all I ever wanted was time
You know that all I ever wanted was time
You know all that we ever really needed was time I am done, I'm done, I don't care how you feel
I am done, I'm done for now
And I see, I see with every glance I steal
I am done, I'm done for now

You say you're used to playing with fire
You say your heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well, that ain't showing through to me

And I see, I see that I could do no wrong
In my old man’s eyes
And I swear, I swear that I would try it, oh
Before the day I died

You say you're used to playing with fire
You say your heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well, that ain't showing through to me

And I guess I knew it
This whole time
But these old feelings
Have made me blind

You say you're used to playing with fire
You say your heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well, that ain't showing through to me
You say you're used to playing with fire
You say your heart is on your sleeve
You say you're sometimes sentimental
Well, that ain't showing through to me
No, that ain't showing through to me I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh and they come unstuck
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh and they come unstuck
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh oooh
Ooh ooh and they come unstuck I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now I saw you standing there
Sandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down
Just like a waterfall
And if you need a light
I'll be the match to your candle
My darling, I'm ready, to burst into flames for you

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Looking like that, you'll open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
But is it too soon?
To know that I'm with you
There's nothing I can do

And sometime around one
We fell asleep to escape from the sun
And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
We stood at your front door
You looked at me and said ""Baby, this rain changes everything""
And my heart ran away from me

I was just coasting till we met
You remind me just how good it can get

Well I've been on fire, dreaming of you
Tell me you don't
It feels like you do
Opening up can open some wounds
How does it start?
And when does it end?
Only been here for a moment, but I know I want you
Darling, I do
I'm with you

There's nothing I won't do to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line
And it's high time that you love me
'Cause you do it so well to see you shine
I'll swing for the fences
I'll run to the line
And it's high, high time

Oh darling, I'm with you
Oh darling, I'm with you
There's nothing I won't do
There's nothing I won't do

I'm with you
Oh, darling, I'm with you Talking like we used to do
It was always me and you
Shaping up and shipping out
Check me in and check me out
Do you like walking in the rain?
When you think of love, do you think of pain?
You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe
Hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Your mess is mine
See you in the marketplace
Walking 'round at 8am
Got 2 hours before my flight
Luck be on my side tonight
You're the reason that I feel so strong
The reason that I'm hanging on
You know you gave me all the time
Oh, did I give enough of mine?
Hold on, darling
This body is yours
This body is yours and mine
Well hold on, my darling
This mess was yours
Now your mess is mine
Bring me to your house
Tell me sorry for the mess
Hey, I don't mind
You're talking in your sleep
Out of time
Well, you still make sense to me
Your mess is mine
Your mess is mine
This body's yours and this body's mine
Your mess is mine Why
Why do you go wasting your time on me
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much that’s left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
And why
Why do you go flashing those eyes at me
You know that I'm eager to please
I’ve always been eager to please
Oh yeah, babe
But I, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you’ve got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days
Oh why
Oh why
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans
Why
Why do you go wasting your youth on me
You’re so beautiful now
There’s so much time left for you now
Oh yeah, babe
Why
We look at the faces on your bedroom wall
Nobody’s perfect at all
Well, sometimes it makes you feel small
Oh yeah, babe
Well I, I’ve got a lot to say
And I'm scared that you’re gonna slip away
And you, you’ve got this wide-eyed gaze
And a smile that you'll carry through your days
Oh why
Oh why
It’s the easiest way
To know you’re alive
And the beauty you heard
I see her talking with her hands
Well I don’t think she knows
How she changed all my plans
The things that I thought would last
Well they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
They’re changing, they’re changing
The things that I thought would last
Well they’re fading, they’re fading
The feelings I used to have
They’re changing, they’re changing, they're changing now
They’re changing, they're changing now
They’re changing, they're changing now I'm so gone
Anyone could see that I'm wasted
You cut through
And I just wanna know what's in your head

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go
Hidden in a place you know I'll find it
Later when I'm sitting all alone

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defenses come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Snow comes down, everything is new and different
I found you hidden in plain sight, why'd I take so long?

Write it on a piece of paper, honey
Put it in my coat before I go

Let me in
Everything starts at your skin, so new
Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby

Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now

Your love's always finding me out
Who am I kidding?
If all my defences come down, oh baby
Will you lay it all on me now?
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
Lay it all on me now
