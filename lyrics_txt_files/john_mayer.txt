"Ah, ah, ah
Ah...

I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light

Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ay, ay
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...

Yeah, if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Love that's runnin' through my veins for you?
What do I do with all this, what do I do with all this
Ooh, yeah Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees


Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where, now, keep me where the light is It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's going to come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch, because you can
You try to hit me, just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand

We're going down
And you can see it, too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room

Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?

My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Burning room

Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we ought to know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow? She's a good girl, loves her mama
Loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
Loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts

And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin', now I'm
Free fallin'

I want to glide down over Mulholland
I want to write her, her name in the sky
I want to free fall out into nothing
Oh, I'm gonna leave this, this world for a while

Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'

Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Free fallin', fallin'
Yeah, yeah How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood? A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be


And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on the steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the God and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?


So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said, ""Help me understand""
He said, ""Turn 68, you'll renegotiate""

""Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train""

Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

Singing, ""Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
'Cause, now, I see, I'll never stop this train"" Moving on and getting over
Are not the same, it seems to me
'Cause you've been gone, I'm growing older
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time

Moving on and getting over
Are not the friends they used to be
It's been so long since I got to hold you
But I still can't seem to get you off my mind
And I do believe I feel you all the time, all the time

Tell me I can have the fact you've loved me to hold onto
Tell me I can keep the door cracked open, to let light through
For all my running, I can understand
I'm one text away from being back again
But I'm moving on and I'm getting over
I'm getting over, I'm getting over
I got to get over

Moving on and getting over
It's been so long; it just goes to show you
That I still can't seem to get you off my mind (get you off my mind)
And I sure would like to see you one more time

It's taken me so long just to say ""so long""
And baby it's so wrong, but I'm moving on
I'm gonna get a new girl
A something-I-can-do-girl
To try to get me through, girl
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'm moving on
Consider me as good as gone
'Cause I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Moving on, baby
Moving on
Moving on Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter

Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire I still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
I still feel
I still feel
I still feel like your man

The prettiest girl in the room she wants me
I know because she told me so
She says come over
I'd like to get to know you
But I just don't think I can

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man

I still keep your shampoo in my shower
In case you wanna wash your hair
And I know that you probably found yourself some more somewhere
But I do not really care
'Cause as long as it is there

I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man, oh mama
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man, your man

(Ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met)
Still like the letters in your name and how they feel, babe
Still think I'm never gonna find another you
Still like to leave the party early and go home, babe
And don't you know, babe
I'd rather sit here on my own and be alone, be—

'Cause I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
(I still feel like) Still feel like your man (oh honey)
Still feel like your man
I still feel like your man
Still feel like your man
Still feel like your man (And I don't know why)
Still feel like your man

I still feel like
I still feel like
I still feel like
I still, I still One, two. One, two, three

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
But when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change


And we're still waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population
So we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change

Now we keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll


Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall? Rosie
Come down and get the door for me
I'm drunk again, remember when we used to be?
Rosie
I know you said no more for me
But that was all before this dream that just came to me

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Rosie
You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see, I learned those words for you

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

Don't leave me here
Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key
And your bedroom neighborhood
And be sleepwalking in Hollywood

I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'd get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me
""I love you, take a right""
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight

I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

I think I'm going to stay
Going to stay in the gray
Think I'm going to stay
And all the street lights say
""Never mind, never mind""
And the canyon lines say
""Never mind, never mind""
The sunset says
""We see this all the time""
Never mind, never you mind

Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar Oh honey
You don't have to try so hard
To hurt me
Don't worry
I been thinking bout you too
What do we do

Your heart is where my head should be
The dissonance is killing me
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

Oh honey
I been talking to myself
Just to hear you
And you're saying
Everything I wish you would
And it's so good

It's raining on the mission bell
They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on

I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be ok
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart

Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
Until it's gone It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it

You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand

Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow

Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)

I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend) Young and full of running
Tell me where has that taken me
Just a great figure eight or a tiny infinity
Love is really nothing
But a dream that keeps waking me
For all of my trying, we still end up dying
How can it be

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me

So young and full of running
All the way to the edge of desire
Steady my breathing, silently screaming
I have to have you now
Wired and I'm tired
Think I'll sleep in my clothes on the floor
Or maybe this mattress will spin on its axis
And find me on yours

Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me


Don't say a word, just come over and lie here with me
Because I'm just about to set fire to everything I see
I want you so bad, I'll go back on the things I believe
There I just said it, I'm scared you'll forget about me We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands) ""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away

You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for

Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Where the sun hits my face all different
Carry me away
Carry me away Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything

No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave

Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man

No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave

So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart

Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby, kiss me, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out

Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out, oh
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out

In the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out

I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
Giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

Oh, in the darkest night, I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out Now and then I pace my place
I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year

But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

I still have dreams, they’re not the same
They don’t fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, “You don’t remember me do you?”

But all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Because one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it’s such a waste to grow up lonely

Still got time, still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
Got a mom, got a dad
But they do not have each other

So line on up and take your place
Show your face to the morning
Because one of these days you’ll be
Born and raised and it
All comes up without warning No, I'm not the man I used to be, lately
See, you met me at an interesting time
And if my past is any sign of your future
You should be warned before I let you inside

Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

I will beg my way into your garden
And then I'll break my way out, when it rains
Just to get back to the place where I started
So I can want you back all over again
(I don't really understand)

Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you

Who do you love?
Girl I see through, through your love
Who do you love; me or the thought of me?
Me or the thought of me?


Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
Hold on to whatever will get you through
Hold on to whatever you find, baby
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you
I don't trust myself with lovin' you The same drink that gets me out the door
Is the same drink that puts me on the floor
And the new thing I wanna try some more
Is the same mistake I used to make before

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

The same brain that brings me ecstacy
Is the same pain that gets the best of me
And the one I love the most just said to me
A broken heart is all I'll ever be

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out

Help me
Help me
Help me

If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
If I'm helpless tell me now
Tell me now
And I'll stop trying to figure it out
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
If I'm helpless
Then I'll stop trying to figure it out When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can

Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything

She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can

She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away

She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands

She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away Walt Grace
Desperately hating his whole place
Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive
Inside his basement
Tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive

Because when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he'd try

But with the will to work hard
And a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

That morning
The sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
From dry land
He rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone

Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide

And the sky was a flare
As he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride

One evening
When weeks had passed since he's leaving
The call she planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she never expected
The operator connected
The call from Tokyo

Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side

And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
Who took a homemade, fan-blade
One-man submarine ride I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay

Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why? When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Now, do I have to fall asleep with roses in my hand?
Do I have to fall asleep with roses in my, roses in my hands?
And would you get them if I did?
No you won’t
‘Cause you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
Verse 
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's good Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find

Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?

Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily

Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside

Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?


We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems
Better put 'em in quotations

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Walking like a one man army
Fighting with the shadows in your head
Living out the same old moment
Knowing you'd be better off instead
If you could only

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Have no fear for giving in
Have no fear for giving over
You'd better know that in the end
It's better to say too much
Than never say what you need to say again
Even if your hands are shaking
And your faith is broken
Even as the eyes are closing
Do it with a heart wide open

Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say
Say what you need to say

Say what you need to say Some of us, we're hardly ever here
The rest of us, we're born to disappear
How do I stop myself from being just a number?
How will I hold my head to keep from goin' under?

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me

How did they find me here?
What do they want from me?
All of these vultures hiding right outside my door
I hear them whispering
They're tryin' to ride it out
They've never gone this long without a kill before

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, testing me


Wheels up
I got to leave this evening
I can't seem to shake these vultures off of my trail
Power is made by power being taken
So I keep on running to protect my situation

Down to the wire
I wanted water, but I'll walk through the fire
If this is what it takes to take me even higher
Then I'll come through
Like I do when the world keeps testing me, testing me, now

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do about it?
Whatcha gonna do 'bout it?
Don't give up, give up
Don't give up, give up, give up
Don't you give up
Don't give up, give up, give up I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing
Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own
Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing

Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing


I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing
Changing River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history


I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through

I'm going to find another you

You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue

I'm going to find another you

When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too

So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do

Oh
I'm going to find another you Waiting on the day
Where my thoughts are my own
When this house is my home
And plans are made

When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

When my life on the run
Bleaches out in the sun
And shows my age
I'm waiting on the day
When that voice comes to say
It's not wrong what you did
For just a kid

When you'll be there for me babe
When you'll love me all the way
When you take my side in every little firefight
When you hang your things and stay
I'm waiting on the day

Waiting on the day
When these words are in stone
When the kids are all grown
And we go dancing

Oh can you do it babe?
Can you love me all the way?
Will you tie me tight in little strands of paradise?
Will you walk with me before the morning fades?

I'm waiting on the day
Come back
Come back in our home
Come back in our home
Come back in our home One last drink to drink wishful thinkin'
And then another again
The bar is getting brighter
And the walls are closin' in
Journey on the jukebox singin'
Don't let the believin' end
The one that you had eyes for
Had their eyes for your best friend

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home

Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light
And roll it on home

Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Roll it on home Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny, metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
The once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
They're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

My red is so confident that he flashes
Trophies of war and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go around
My yellow, in this case, is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

I'm bold, bold as love
Yeah I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Just ask the axis
Yeah he knows, he knows, he knows, he knows everything


I'm bold, bold as love
I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking to you
I'm bold, bold as love, yeah It doesn't matter where you roam
When no one's left to call you home
I might have strayed a bit too far
I'm counting all the moonlit stars

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away
I saw her face and I could tell
My ghost had left the town as well

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me
Here out on the highway

Maybe I'm a runaway train
Maybe I'm a feather in a hurricane
Maybe it's a long play game
But maybe that's a good thing

But I will be found
But I will be found
When my time comes down
But I will be found

Keep on running until my run is gone
Keep on riding until I see that dawn
And I will be found
I will be found I worry
I weigh three times my body
I worry
I throw my fear around
But this morning
There's a calm I can't explain
The rock candy's melted, only diamonds now remain
Ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo

By the time I recognize this moment
This moment will be gone
But I will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
When all I got's
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will wait to find
If this will last forever
And I will pay no mind
When it won't and it won't because it can't
It just can't
It's not supposed to

Was there a second of time that I looked around?
Did I sail through or drop my anchor down?
Was anything enough to kiss the ground
And say I'm here now?
And she is here now
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo

So much wasted in the afternoon
So much sacred in the month of June
How 'bout you, oh?

And I will wait to find
If this will last forever, yeah
And I will wait to find
That it won't and it won't
And it won't
And I will pay no mind
Worried 'bout no rainy weather
And I will waste no time
Remaining in our lives together Goodbye cold, goodbye rain
Goodbye sorrow, and goodbye shame
I'm headed out west with my headphones on
Boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
And no one knows

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down

Hello beauty, hello strange
Hello wonder, what's your name?
Looking for the Sun that Neil Young hung
After the Gold Rush of 1971

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down


If you see her, say hello
Just don't tell me, I told you so
Joni wrote ""Blue"" in her house by the sea
I've got to believe there's another color waiting on me
To set me free

I just found out her ghost left town
The queen of California is stepping down, down I work in the dead of night
When the roads are quiet and no one is around
To track my moves, racing the yellow lights
To find the gate is open, she's waiting in the room
I just slip on through

You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

Enter the morning light
To find the day is burning the curtains and the wine
In a little white room
No I'm not alone, her head is heavy on me
She's sleeping like a child
What could I do?

You get in, you get done and then you get gone
You never leave a trace, or show your face, you get gone
Should've turned around and left before the sun came up again
But the sun came up again

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

Suddenly I'm in over my head and I can hardly breathe
Suddenly I'm floating over her bed and I feel everything
Suddenly I know exactly what I did, but I can not move a thing
And suddenly I know exactly what I'd done
And what it's going to mean to me, mean to me
I'm gone

I was a killer, was the best they'd ever seen
I'd steal your heart before you ever heard a thing
I'm an assassin and I had a job to do
Little did I know that girl was an assassin too

She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin
She's an assassin and she had a job to do I guess I just feel like
I guess I just feel like
Nobody's honest, nobody's true
Everyone's lyin' to make it on through
I guess I just feel like I'm the same way too

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I guess I just feel like good things are gone
And the weight of my worries is too much to take on
I think I remember the dream that I had
That love's gonna save us from a world that's gone mad
I guess I just feel like
What happened to that?


I guess I just feel like the joke's gettin' old
And the future is fading and the past is on hold
But I know that I'm open and I know that I'm free
And I'll always let hope in wherever I'll be
And if I go blind, I'd still find my way
I guess I just felt like givin' up today

Mmm, yeah, yeah Well, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

I'm thinking something like Olivia is
What I need to find

There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side
There's only one man in this world
Who gets to sleep with her by his side

I'm thinking something like Olivia
Could keep me through the night


Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
Now I'm not trying to steal
No love away from no one man
But if Olivia herself were at my door
I'd have to say, I'd let her in

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia

I keep thinking something like Olivia
Is what I need to find

Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
Something like Olivia
I keep thinking something like Olivia Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh

Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong
Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls

Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""
Ooh! Ooh!

No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are
Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it

Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, why should I care?""

Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, ""Worry, get out of here"" Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

And now I'm walking in a park
All of the birds they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me

Oh, it's taking so long I could be wrong
I could be ready
Oh, but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair

I'm never really ready
Oh I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people out of the ocean
We have the feeling like we were floating
We never noticed where time was going
Do you remember when we first got here
The days were longer, the nights were hot here
Now, it's September; the engine's starting
You're empty-handed and heavy-hearted

But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line

You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two


Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
It don't come often, and it don't stay long

But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no one Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

You whisper, come on over
Cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning, I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into the jealous game
The streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

Friends, lovers, or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We'll never be the inbetween
So give it up
We'll never the inbetween
So give it up

Anything other than 'yes' is 'no'
Anything other than 'stay' is 'go'
Anything less than 'I love you' is lying... I just remembered, that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rode down, aisle 5
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
Can't remember, what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure that you'd remind me, if you had to

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say she's going to be good for you
They throw me, high fives
She says the bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party
And she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish
Miles from Coltrane

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
Say

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweat pants, no makeup, so perfect

Our love was, comfortable and
So broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, ""Well anyway...""
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for me

How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon

We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess
With the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again

How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now

One more thing
Why is it my fault
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
Just want to be liked
Just want to be funny
Looks like the joke's on me
So call me Captain Backfire

I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now And these days with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned
Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watching CNN
It's dark, I know
But then again
It's the brightest thing I've got

When I'm covered in rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain

From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now, and now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back now
Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I got

Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain


And come December Lydia left
She mentioned something about it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree
And it's killing me
And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers around a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I got

When I'm covered in rain And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
When you say it's alright
You got your heart right

Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left

So maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I want to know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)

I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away

'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight) I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway

Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s

I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me

Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say

But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s No, I've not seen you this way before
Standing a mess at my door
Well, it took you so long
But you finally found
You're no one until someone lets you down
You believed that all people are kind
And that you'd never mess with your mind
You gave her your trust
And she busted your crown
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I've been told
That some people grow old
Without losing a part of their soul
But if that is true
I don't wish it on you
There's so much to adore in a heart that is blue
There's a light in your eyes that is pure
That you won't give away anymore
But just think of the things
We can talk about now
You're no one until someone lets you down
Yes, I have heard
There are some that avoid
All the pain that will come with the fall
But if that's the case
It would surely erase
All the joy that you feel
When the hurt fades away

There's a heart ticket train on the way
Waitin' to take you away
Will you please keep in mind
When it pulls into town
You're no one until someone lets you down
You're no one until someone lets you down I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been
You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small
And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home

Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time

Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home

Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home I'm not alone
I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy, but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
And you never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Friends (check)
Money (check)
A well slept (check)
Opposite sex (check)
Guitar (check)
Microphone (check)
Messages waiting on me when I come home (check)

How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries? Here comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You, enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just until St. Patrick's Day Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest (honest)
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now We pick up in New York City
I'm tryna find a man I never got to be
But when I push down on the pavement
I found the whole thing so much harder than it seemed
The only deal I ever signed
No devil drew a dotted line
The stage was set, the words were mine
I'm not complaining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Every night around this time
My friends and I, we treat it like a race
When I really start to break it down
I wouldn't trust a girl who knew about this place
Barking on with no one left
Speak softly underneath my breath
""Hey world, you ain't seen nothing yet""
Great, now it's raining

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Dreamed somebody missed me
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
And repeat and repeat after me

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water, sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Wake up, shake it off, and repeat
It's just a phase, it's not forever
It's just a phase, but I still might have a ways to go

Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Water, water, water sleep
Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey
Cut me off and pour me in the street Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so

Hand me down my golden hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big old empty arms
Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
What can I say
Hey, hey
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long


The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, calling over those hills People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say ""move along""
Their minds say ""gotcha heart""
""Let's move it along""
Move it along

And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her

And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me

You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again

And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now

You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me (You can't love too much, one part of it)
(You can't love too much, one part of it)
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me
I believe
That my life's going to see the love I give return to me Had a little love, but I spread it thin
Falling in her arms and out again
Made a bad name for my game around town
Tore up my heart, and shut it down

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

I see friends around from time to time
When their ladies let them slip away
And when they ask me how I'm doing with mine
This is always what I say

Nothing to do
Nowhere to be
A simple little kind of free
Nothing to do
No one but me
And that's all I need

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Because I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me

And this is not to say
There never comes a day
I'll take my chances and start again
And when I look behind
On all my younger times
I have to thank the wrongs that led me to a love so strong

I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely
I'm perfectly lonely (Yeah)
Cause I don't belong to anyone
Nobody belongs to me
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it
That's the way, that's the way, that's the way that I want it I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know her hairs are on my shirts

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said ""I love you""
Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 a.m., I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens

I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name

From the battery
To the gallery
It's the kind of thing you only see
In scented, glossy magazines

And I can't remember life before her name I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" on the radio

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay
Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well

And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83

And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt

Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision? Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late

Over you
I'm never over
Over you
Something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me

Yeah
I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way

Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette

Yeah
Should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do

Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah

Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay
If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away
Free
Free

Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, ""Come upstairs, you've got some work to do""

When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?
When are you going to wise up boy?

You are hiding in your mind
Working all the time
Trying to make it better than you got it
And you been spending all your time
Searching for a sign
That's never going to look the way you want it

I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy
I think you better wise up, boy Just when I had you off my head
Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you want to try again
But I've tried everything but giving in

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

I bought a ticket on a plane
And by the time it landed, you were gone again
I love you more than songs can say
But I can't keep running after yesterday, so

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

We say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye Love is a Verb
It ain't a thing

It's not something you hold
It's not something you scream
When you show me love
I don't need your words

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

Love ain't a crutch
It's not an excuse
No you can't get through love
On just a pile of IOU's
Love ain't a drug
Despite what you've heard

Yeah, love ain't a thing
Love is a verb
Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb

So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb
So you've got to show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Show me, show me, show me
Love is a verb

Love ain't a thing
Love is a verb This is a call to the color-blind
This is an IOU
I'm stranded behind a horizon line
Tied up in something true

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for

Why is it not my time
What is there more to learn
Shed this skin I've been tripping in
Never to quite return

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body gives me credit for
Cause I'm bigger than my body now

Maybe I'll tangle in the power lines
And it might be over in a second's time
But I'll gladly go down in a flame
If a flame's what it takes to remember my name
To remember my name

Yes, I'm grounded
Got my wings clipped
I'm surrounded by all this pavement
Guess I'll circle
While I'm waiting for my fuse to dry
For my fuse to dry
Wait for my fuse to dry

Someday I'll fly
Someday I'll soar
Someday I'll be so damn much more
Cause I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body
I'm bigger than my body now They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
They call me the breeze
I keep blowing down the road
I've got nobody
I'm carrying no load
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
There's no change in the weather
There's no change in me
I'm not hiding from nobody
Nobody’s hiding from me
I got that green light babe
I've got to keep moving on
I got that green light, babe
I've got to keep moving on
I might go up to California
Might go down to Georgia
I don’t know Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed (come on back to bed)

What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with

You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed

You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
Ninety-eight and six degrees of separation from you baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?

Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love Come out angels, come out ghosts
Come out darkness, bring everyone you know
I'm not running, and I'm not scared
I am waiting, and well prepared

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

I got a hammer, and a heart of glass
I got to know right now, which walls to smash
I got to pocket, got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will
All the suffering
And all the pain
Never left a name

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

No more suffering
No more pain
Never again

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on
So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on  Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone
And the music on my radio
Isn't supposed to make me feel alone

What a drag to know
I have to learn to let it go

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Well they’re celebrating broken things
I don’t want a world of broken things
You can tell something isn't right
When all your heroes are in black and white

What a drag to say
At least I still have yesterday

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me
Someone come speak for me

I'm not mad about it
But I'm not mad about it
I'm not mad about it
But I'm not that mad about it

Show me something I can be
Play a song that I can sing
Make me feel as I am free
Someone come speak for me

Now the cover of a Rolling Stone
Ain't the cover of a Rolling Stone Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
The mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway
The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes
Saying ""if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now.""
Because everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but
I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
Cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me, yeah yeah
Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me, yeah
Always, oh oh
Always been to me, yeah, yeah
Always been to me Don't know why Tori came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori had been driving around the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why, but Tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding

She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can't look out behind at the road

She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do

Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye

Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure she's fine Staying home alone on a Friday
Flat on the floor looking back on old love
Or lack thereof
After all the crushes are faded
And all my wishful thinking was wrong
I'm jaded, I hate it

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here (get here)

Searching all my days just to find you
I'm not sure who I'm looking for
I'll know it when I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I could have met you in a sandbox
I could have passed you on the sidewalk
Could I have missed my chance
And watched you walk away

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here, oh yeah

I'm tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here
So tired of being alone
So hurry up and get here

You'll be so good
You'll be so good for me This is my bar and you know it
You never came in here before I showed it to you
And now I see you walking through that door
With a dress that I've been waiting for
And I know what you're trying to do
And I know what you want me to say
Funny, I was thinking about you yesterday
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
I used to worship the ground you walked on
And you walked all over me
And you looked me in the eye and said goodbye
And you did it so casually
And I know what you're trying to do
'Cause I see who you're talking to
And you send your pretty little eyes my way
But oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who wants someone all the way
And I don't want someone, who don't want someone
Who don't want someone to ever get away
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
You can try, you can try
But I’m way to high to fight it anyway
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care, I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care
Oh, I just remembered that I didn't care I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight

Stop trying to figure it out
(you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be
The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme
For ""heavier things"" It's just the strangest thing
I've seen your face somewhere
An early evening dream, a past life love affair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all?

In all my reverie
I thought I felt us there
A feather in my hand
A flower in your hair

Do you know me at all?
Do you know me at all? One, two
One, two, three

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised""

Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, ""Now I'm born and raised"" Suppose I said
I am on my best behavior
There are times
I lose my worried mind

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

Suppose I said
Colors change for no good reason
And words will go
From poetry to prose

Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else

And I, in time, will come around
I always do for you

Suppose I said
You're my saving grace

Would you want me when I'm not myself
(My grace, myself, not myself, when I'm someone else)
Wait it out while I am someone else
(When I'm someone else, when I'm someone else, when I'm not myself)
Would you want me when I'm not myself
Wait it out while I am someone else How sad it is that time should pass
Her Majesty, the hourglass
We take the sand of bygone years
And make mud of it with all our tears
What is now compared to then
And will I ever love again?
The answer to the answer brings
The endless search for everything I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking down I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there

Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life

Been holding out for a home life
My whole life

I can tell you this much
II will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change (home life doesn't change)

I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk, but
I've got to leave you cause my ride is here

In my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life
Home life
Home life Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

Fool me once and it's shame on you
Twice it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be

Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you

Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days

Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors

Check your pulse
It's proof that you're not listening to
The call your life's been issuing you
The rhythm of a line of idle days Once upon most every morning
I woke up to her flying there
Hummingbird was making blows of
Blowing rings of purple in the air
All the while
I was trying to keep her there
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That's all I heard
That's my hummingbird
Just because I said I didn't want her
Doesn't mean I want her to go
In fact, I quite depended on her
But that I didn't want her to know
Now that's she's gone I know
All the while
I was trying to keep her there, ya
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That song i heard, I heard
That's my Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Is it too late
Too late, hummingbird? I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery

I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)

No, no, no, I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled, yeah
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill
Now the doctor say I need rest
For I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah


All I need is my baby, please!
Won't you please just come on home?
Come on home Do not waste this evening
Baby, I'm begging you
Your big imagination's playing its tricks on you
If you think my up and leaving's something I'm going to do
Feel my chest when I look at you
Baby you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

So hard to be so far out
Living our separate lives
Your phone was really broken
I tried your number twice
And if you need confirmation, baby I understand
It's alright if you want me to
Tell you you

You got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only
Only heart

And you live like your hand's on the horn, baby
I adore you but there's a hole in the cup that should hold my love (hold my love)
If you let, if you let, if you let me leave
I swear I never will

Remember now
You, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart
Yeah, you got my only heart Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Tell me pretty baby is he good to you
Can he do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
Oh, oh, oh, I'm on fire
Sometimes it feels like someone took a knife
Baby do you know and cut a six-inch valley
Through the middle of my skull
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you can cool my desire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire
Oh, oh, oh I'm on fire, ooh ooh Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way, that's the highway, that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than two thousand miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin Missouri
Oklahoma City, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66

Well it goes through St. Louie, Joplin, Missouri
Oklahoma City, looks so so pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona, Tulsa and Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino

Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip?
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66
Get your kicks on Route 66 Go easy on me for the night has been long
I’m not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I’ll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me
Oh, I don’t need your truth
Or a good talking-to from your mountain
No, I don’t know your name and I won’t take the blame
Don’t know what you need, so go easy on me
Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It’s possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I’m not here to spar so go easy on me
Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn’t move me
See, my heart barely works and it’s covered in dirt
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me
Oh, I see in your eyes
You don’t realize what you’re doing
So, here’s some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you’re not going to be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me I'm a good man
In a dark room
In a big town
Under a full moon
It's a friday and I'm almost home
I'm in a good place
Full of head space
Got a brand new pack in my suitcase
But it's dinner and then it's bed alone
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
Gonna make it, like I need her
Gonna miss her the moment I meet her
And it's only gonna get worse from there
I'll be rappin' there in the shower
She'll be here by the end of the hour
I can do better
But I can't do better now
How do you break a mended heart?
I'm bored and want something to do
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
So long is over
Nice to skip the chance you get to know you
Why did I think this was true?
Because I want to
I wanna fall, fall asleep
Asleep in the arms, the arms of a woman
A woman who doesn't, doesn't deserve my love
I wanna lie, lie to myself
Myself and someone else
Just to feel something, something that hurts me
The hurt makes me feel alive
I wanna fall
I wanna need
I wanna laugh, cry, say goodbye
Beg, lie, cheat and steal Midnight
Lock all the doors
And turn out the lights
Feels like the end of the world
This Sunday night
There's not a sound
Outside the snow's coming down

And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Three o' two
The space in this room
Has turned on me
And all my fears have cornered me here
Me and my TV screen
The volume's down
Blue lights are dancing around

And somehow I can't seem to find
The quiet inside my mind

Daylight is climbing the walls
Cars start and feet walk the halls
The world awakes and now I am safe
At least by the light of day
At least by the light of day Six numbers, one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call
Been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me

Oh, oh, oh
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

Oh, I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playing the part of the Queen
Taking my own advice, I'm giving up tonight
Good luck to you and the king

Excuse Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is that I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know, life as the man
Living life as the man on the side Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
I tried to call been busy all night
Gave up waitin' at daylight

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me, if you wanted me

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side

One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me, hey, hey

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side

I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Takin' my own advice
I'm givin' up tonight, good luck to you and the king

Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can?
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When, when you wanted me
Ohh, when you wanted babe

I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as a man, you know life as a man
Livin' life as a man on the side I know you've been sworn
I read your complaint
You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over
Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are

Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it

You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
It's what we are

Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
That we've been playing in tonight

I'm calling it love soon
I'm calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are Sometimes, I wish that I was the weather
You'd bring me up in conversation forever
And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day
Oh, sometimes I wish that I was a cold beer
I'd rest assured that you would hold me near
I'd be guaranteed to be just what you need

And there could be no other way, because you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, they're all the same
Yeah, I would walk and I'd surely walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you

Sometimes, I wish that I was a bong hit
You'd let me in and you would love every minute
And tell the room the things I did to you


I see your world with rosy colored glasses on
Want to right what I see wrong
I could never have that power over you
Someday, I'm got to pack up and leave this town
I'm got to get my own things going on
And when I do, I'll forget, I'll forget

I'll forget about how, how you're so, you're so lame
Your tired words are all, your tired words are all the same
And I would walk, you know I'd, I'd walk away
If I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you
I wasn't such a sucker for you I got dreams
Dreams to remember
X3
Oh Gravity
X2
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away
Gravity
Is working against me
And gravity
Wants to bring me down
Twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one-half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees
Gravity
Stay the hell away from me
Gravity
Has taken better men than me
Now how can that be?
Just keep me where the light is
Keep me where the light is Do you ever get the feelin
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve known ourselves that long
And i can't say i really blame you for being bored with the beginning
Always staring at the score to figure out whos barely winning
But dont you know
There is a reason strong moves slow
And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line
We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
And if you want to know the moment
I knew that i was still alone
I found i never learned your number
I only stored it in my phone
Youd think by now
Id know the shape of calling home
And im okay
If youre okay with wasting time
But when you trace
You always see the bottom line
We are tracing
I hope you know
We are tracing
Were both alone
We are tracing
We are tracing
Did you ever get the feeling
That we started in the middle?
Or have you ever had the sense
That weve been lying just a little?
I mean come on
Its not like weve knew ourselves that long When I'm standing in the sun
I never really stop to think and miss someone
But when I lose that light
Blue skies at night

When those evening stars shine down
I suddenly remember that you're not around
And I face that fight
Blue skies at night

These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
So tired of all these broken dreams
I'm better on my own it seems

Dog in a ball at the end of my bed
Yet, I wish it was the three of us in yours instead
But I do what's right
Blue skies at night

These are the hardest kind of years
The ones where people disappear
Who's crying all these winter tears?
They're hanging like this chandelier

And there beside the morning grave
A stronger man in place of where a fool once laid
But for one more day
Blue skies
So come what may
Blue skies
I'll find my way
Blue skies at night This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be a-okay
All my bills have all gone pink
I shit the bed
I broke the bed
This coulda been a slow song
A laundry list of all the wrongs
But end of the day
This is my beautiful disaster-piece I've made
And it goes and I quote ""it will never be like this""
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
I don't understand the numbers
But my faith is in the math
That the odds are all this pain will leave and I will live and
And we'll look back and laugh
And to all the hearts I've broken
And the ones that once broke mine
I've got suspicions, all will be forgiven in time
All you gotta do is call them up and say that now
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
And if it ever gets bad
I mean really bad
I'll move to Nova Scotia
Forget the life I had
I'll be up at 9 each morning
Down by the shore
Collecting things that fell off boats in storms
Well ok so I might never
But it's nice to know the option's there
This will all make perfect sense someday
I'll be A-Okay
This will all make perfect sense someday
There's got to be a reason for the rain
A reason for the rain (x3)
And it doesn't help
That I keep biting my lip in the same place I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good

You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
But then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good
Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know that the heart of my life is good
Of your life is good

We're in repair
We're not together but we're getting there And these days
And these days
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish I was six again
If only my...

I've these dreams of
Walking home
Home where it used to be
Everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me
Here I stand, six feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bittersweet feeling hearing No Such Thing on the radio

And these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be more like they were at the start of me
Had it made in '83

Thinking 'bout my brother Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother John
But on an 18-month delay
He's a-okay, by the way
Here I stand, six feet small
And smiling cause I'm scared as hell
Kind of like life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actors' names have changed
Oh well

Well, these days
I wish I was six again
Oh, make me a red cape
I wanna be Superman

Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
I wish things would be more like they were at the start of me
If my life was more like 1983
Plot a course to the source of the purest little part of me

And most my memories
Have escaped me or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of Bridgeport, CT, and 1983
You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards, replace the shutters
But that's my plastic in the dirt
Whatever happened to my, whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father says, What you gonna do with your life?
Oh Daddy dear, you know, you're still number one
But girls, they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have, oh no, no, no, no
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, girls, let's hear it for the boys
Let's hear it for my baby
Let's hear it for the boys
Oh, let's give the boy a hand
Oh, oh, maybe he's no Romeo
But he's my loving, one-man show
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If only my life
Ba, ba-da, ba, ba-da
If my life was more like '83 I saw you sleeping on the couch tonight
You know it serves you right
Makes you luckier than i
All the colors in the room have changed
Appear to disagree
But brother ive discovered you
We're pushin on
We're passin through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
But im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isn't it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
The same
We're never where we wanna be
That's ok with me
It's just the way it is it seems
It feels like make believe
But you're my history
But brother i've rediscovered you and
We're pushing on
We're passing through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
Im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isnt it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
Round and round
Can't believe my heart has waited this long
All along
We've been children in a cold world where
Wonder was lost every day
And if love was a compass
Oh i have lost my way If melody is my destiny
Then what's left of me
I'll give to you
If next to me
Is all that you need to be
Would you settle for fantasy
If it's the best you could do
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've work so hard to realize
Can postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away
Would I be satisfied
And find peace inside
Rolling half my life
Over broken white lines
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Will I wake up one morning
And see your face
And streaks on the window
That the rainstorm makes
Could you bear all the weight
And the strength that it takes
Could I ever break away
Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to
Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've worked so hard to realize
Can a postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away Buzzing just like neon
Buzzing just like neon I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't know what it's like to land and not race to your door
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key in your bedroom neighborhood
Me sleep-walking in Hollywood
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I don't think I'm gonna go to LA anymore
I get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me â€~I love you, take a right'
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight
I'm gonna steer clear
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you
I'm gonna steer clear, oh yeah
I'd burn up in your atmosphere
I'm gonna steer clear
Â€~Cause I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
See you there
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay in the gray
I think I'm gonna stay, gonna stay, gonna stay
And all the streetlights say nevermind, nevermind
And the canyon lines say nevermind
And sunset says we see this all the time, nevermind, never you mind
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch your life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar Well I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your body
I know not everybody
Has got a body like you
But I've got to think twice
Before I give my heart away
And I know all the games you play
Because I play them too
Oh but I
Need some time off
From that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
Oh, and that love comes down
Without devotion
Well it takes a strong man baby
But I'm showing you the door
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Baby
I know you're asking me to stay
Sayin' please, please, please, don't go away
You say I'm giving you the blues
Maybe
You mean every word you say
Can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to lover boy rules
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Yes I've gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith
Because I got to have faith
Oh yeah, faith
Got to have faith
Before this river
Becomes an ocean
Before you throw my heart back
On the floor
Oh, baby I reconsider
My foolish notion
Well I need someone to hold me
But I'll wait for something more
Because I gotta have faith
I gotta have faith
Because I got to have faith, faith, faith
I gotta have faith, faith, faith I met a man I didn't know that asked me how are you doing
Should have just said fine cause it's all he wanted to hear
But for reasons unknown in a sorrowful tone I said
Man it's been a hell of a year
And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around

And I don't really know where I'm going
And I might just be hanging around
If life's shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds

I went to go see some gypsy to tell me my future
But she asked for my photograph instead
As I walked through the cold with my fortune untold I said
Good luck trying to reach me when I'm dead


I saw the love I used to know swallow me whole
On a day I was out of clean clothes
She sized me up and she said honey how is your head
I said you can't call me honey but honey heaven only knows


Bet your going to be finding a break in the clouds
No, no, no I don't know where I'm going
And I might might might just be hanging around
And if life shades of gray
Then I guess you could say
That I've been waiting for a break in the clouds Just cast away
And I am lost at sea
Another lonely day
And no one here but me
More loneliness
Than any man could bear
Rescue me
Before I fall into despair

I send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle

A year has passed since
I wrote my note
I should have known it
Right from the start
Only hope can
Keep me together
Love can mend your life but
Love can break your heart


Walked out this morning
I don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles
Washed up on the shore
It seems I'm not alone at
Being alone
A hundred million castaways
All looking for a home I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh
Your cat likes me more
Why didn't you think of this first?
Now your cat wishes that he was mine
(I pet your cat a new way)
I pet your dog a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your dog a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
Cuz when I lay this way
He really wants me to stay
I pet your dog a new way
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
I pet your cat a new way
Uh-Uh-Uh
See he's my best friend now
I bet you're wondering how
I pet your cat a new way ""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""
""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing
And there's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's hard to beat the system
When we're standing at a distance
So we keep waiting
Waiting on the world to change

Now, if we had the power
To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
'Cause when they own the information
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change


We're still waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
One day our generation
Is gonna rule the population

So we keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change
Waiting on the world to change Now look at them yo-yo's that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
See the little faggot with the earring and the make-up
Yeah buddy that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot he's millionaire
We gotta install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's
I shoulda' learned to play the guitar
I shoulda' learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera
Man we could have some fun
And he's up there, what's that ? Hawaiian noises ?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free
We gotta install ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We gotta move these refrigerators
We gotta move these color TV's, Lord
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' get your chicks for free
Money for nothin' get chicks for free I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind it screams mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broke pieces of yesterdays life
Says Somewhere a queen is weeping
And Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind it whispers Mary
The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags on down the stream
'cause the life that lived is dead
And the wind it screams Mary
And the wind it cries Mary
Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this won't be the last""
And the wind cries Mary
And the wind cries Mary I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna give up on you and me
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna give up on love
Every beat of my heart baby,pounds with joy but not in vain
Every beat of my heart baby,pounds with joy but not in vain
All those are painful memories, only brought me to my knees
I ain't gonna
I ain't gonna give up on love
Little Johnny Taylor told us all, oh so long ago
What about the midnight cryin'....Woah that cheatin' and lyin'
What about the price that will....Oh surely be paid
Oh when we gave up on love....Love will surely have it's day
If we all just give up on love, yeah
I ain't gonna give up on love
Love ain't gonna,Love ain't gonna,Love ain't gonna
Love ain't gonna give up on me
I ain't gonna give up, I ain't gonna give up,I ain't gonna,I ain't gonna,I ain't gonna, I ain't gonna give up on love
Everytime I try a little good love, good love, good love
Good love just won't let me be
THIS WAS WRITTEN BY STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something

You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying to keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
I know I am someone, and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

Help me sing it
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Help me sing it babe
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Sing it to the world, sing it out loud
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma ku sa I'm a lazy lover
Undercover
Wasting time
Then one day this summer
I changed my number
To cut my line
Good love is on the way
I been lonely but I know, I'll be OK
Good love is on the way
3 years broken-hearted
But now her ghost is finally gone
I'm done with broken people
This is me
I'm working on (because I know)

Good to go for wherever I'm needed
Bags are packed and I'm
Down by the door
You can take all the tricks up my sleeve
I don't need them anymore Six numbers one more to dial
Before I'm before you
And I tried to call-been busy all night
Gave up waiting at daylight
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
One of the many
One of the few
To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
Ooooo I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man on the side
Life as the man on the side
I fell in love with a dream that I built of you
Playin' the part of the queen
Taking my own advice
I'm giving up tonight good luck to you
And the king
Excuse me Mrs. Busybody
Could you pencil me in when you can
Though we both know that the worst part about it
Is I would be free if you wanted me
When! When you wanted me
If you wanted me
If you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hopin' you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man
You know life as the man
Livin' life as the man on the side Violent skies
10 am
Falling on my knees again
Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain
I'm walking a straight line
Stepped on all of the cracks this time
I don't care I'm not moving aside
For anyone
Outside in the underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home
But I've stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I've got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Outside in the underground
Underground
Proud in the rain
Outside in the underground
There's no way out of here today
I raise my head up to the sky again
And make my way alone
I'm never home but I stopped searching
Cause the city told me so
It all comes down
Down to me
Oh I've got a hundred lives
Oh I got to get it right
Oh who knows someday I might
Oh I've got to get it right (Spoken)
Matt Mangano:I like to eat an orange with George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat
An orange with George Malacorange
Oooooooooo
Bop ba ba
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
I like to eat an orange
With my friend George Malacorange
So juicy sweet
So good to eat
An orange with George Malacorange
George is my friend Too many shadows in my room
Too many hours in this midnight
Too many corners in my mind
So much to do to set my heart right
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
Stood on the corner for a while
To wait for the wind to blow down on me
Hoping it takes with it my old ways
And brings some brand new luck upon me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unsteady
I am in repair, I am in repair
And now I'm walking in the park
And all of the birds, they dance below me
Maybe when things turn green again
It will be good to say you know me
Oh, it's taking so long
I could be wrong, I could be ready
Oh but if I take my heart's advice
I should assume it's still unready
Oh, yeah, I'm never really ready
Oh, I'm never really ready
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there
I'm in repair
I'm not together but I'm getting there Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die
Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes
Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin' Beautiful, I watch you try
To see yourself through others' eyes
But mirrors are a losing game
They only show you backwards anyway
The magic and the misery
Come and go so easily
But everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
You were only five years old
Playing princess in your mother's clothes
Could you feel me standing next to you
With my plastic sword and playground shoes
Saying, ""if my dear I'm wrong somehow
May dragons come and fell me now""
'cause everything you'll ever be
You already are to me
Why
I don't know why
I don't know why you think you need to do it
How
I don't know how
I don't know how but I just sit back and I see my way right through it
When the memories are ten feet tall
Throwing shadows on your bedroom wall
When you pull the shades and kill the lights
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Will you hear me singing out tonight?
Days are long and words are cruel
They won't get the best of you
'cause everything you'll ever be
You have always been to me Publishers: ©REACH MUSIC PUBLISHING

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder (I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland
Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and
Though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it
You want love?
We'll make it
Swim in a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes

Your body is a wonderland Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I tried to forget you
I tried to stay away
But it's too late
Over you
I'm never over, over you
There's something about you
It's just the way you move
The way you move me
Yeah, I'm so good at forgetting
And I quit every game I play
But forgive me, love
I can't turn and walk away
This way
Back to you
It always comes around
Back to you
I walk with your shadow
I'm sleeping in my bed
With your silhouette
Yeah, should have smiled in that picture
If it's the last that I'll see of you
It's the least that you
Could not do
Leave the light on
I'll never give up on you
Leave the light on
For me too
For me too
For me too
Yeah
Back to me
I know that it comes
Back to me
Doesn't it scare you
Your will is not as strong
As it used to be Bought a ticket for a trip I wanted long ago
Staring deep into crying eyes
Said goodbye, stood in line, now I changed my mind
I used to run and never look behind

But now, now I've got a love to leave
And now, not gonna walk away so easily

I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

Plane lands short a man on the other side
Driver stands with a sign in faith
Checks his watch as he size up the time gone by
Two lonely pieces circle baggage claim

But yeah, now I've got a love to leave
And yeah, don't you know it changes
Everything, everything

I can't take that plane, I can't take that
I can't take that plane today
I can't take that plane, I can't take that plane

No, I can't, I can't
I can't, I can't

I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now
I'm coming to getcha, I'm coming to getcha now My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, ""Well anyway""
Just dying for a subject change
Oh, it's another social casualty
Score one more for me
How could I forget?
Mama said, ""Think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon
We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong
Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again
How could I forget?
Mama said, ""Think before speaking""
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
One more thing
Why is it my fault?
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
I just wanna be liked
I just wanna be funny
Looks like the jokes on me
So call me captain backfire
I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh, I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now Welcome to the real world
She said to me condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well, I never lived the dream of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
So the good boys and girls
Take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories tiny tragedies
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive
I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for 'Cause it's summer time baby!
And I take myself seriously in the fall
Oh yeah!
Uh-huh!

Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
A Model citizen with zero discipline

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom

Don't you know she's coming home with me
You'll lose her in that turn
I'll get her
(Uh-oh!)
Panama
Panama (ow!)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Woo!

Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off
(You know what I'm sayin')
Ah, reach down between my legs and...ease the seat back
She's runnin', I'm flyin'
Right behind in the rearview mirror now
Got the fearin', power steerin'
Pistons poppin', ain't no stoppin' now

Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama
Panama (ah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Panama! Well if you ever plan to motor west
Just take my way that's the highway that's the best
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well it winds from Chicago to L.A
More than 2000 miles all the way
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66
Well goes from St. Louie down to Missouri
Oklahoma city, the toots look pretty
You'll see Amarillo and Gallup, New Mexico
Flagstaff, Arizona don't forget Winona
Kingman, Barstow, San Bernadino
Would you get hip to this kindly tip
And go take that California trip
Get your kicks on Route 66 Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare Don't know why Tori came by
I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori'd been driving around the town for awhile
Playing with the thought of leaving
Don't know why Tori just smiled
Mentioned something 'bout how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding
She said, ""I might not be seeing him soon
I got a few things I've been waiting to do""
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the backseat inside
Sure it's so, she can't look out behind at the road
She said, ""I might not be seein him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do""
Hey, Tori came by, Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by, she says to say goodbye
Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure that she's fine I know you've been sworn
I read your complaint
You're needing someone older
And though I've been warned to live day by day
There's something taking over
Did you expect to kiss me one time
While looking at me with the same eyes ever again?
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Your mother complains that you need a man
You haven't mentioned me yet
And all of your friends don't know who I am
I've been your best kept secret
I understand I wasn't part of the plan
A dollar short, a minute early
But I am your man
So come on and face it
So come on and face it
It's time that we say it
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are
Let's bypass the bullshit and move on because
The minute hand moves faster than you think it does
And by no fault of yours and by no fault of mine
The bottom line is laying in the bed that we've been playing in tonight
Im calling it love soon
Im calling it love soon
You can cross the line whenever you want to
I'm calling it love soon
Close your mind and waste some time if you have to
I'm calling it love soon
It's not about you now
It's what we are Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside
And all of your things
Tell the sweetest storyline
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
C'mon back to bed
What will this fix?
You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with
You can be mad in the morning
I'll take back what I said
Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
You can be mad in the morning
Or the afternoon instead
But don't leave me
98 and 6 degrees of separation from you, baby
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Come back to bed
Why don't you come back to bed?
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love over my head
Don't hold your love CashMoneyAP
Oh man it's the chronic don't even worry bout it
CashAP got the beat tied

I've been getting money like Monopoly
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
You know that I got control and every part is quality
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
I've been getting money like Monopoly
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy
You know that I got control and every part is quality
Run up on the come up with the bag like a prodigy Lightning strikes

How come the only way to know how high you get me is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me but I can't break through it all
It's a heart... heartbreak...

If you wanted me
Oh, I am the man on the side

To stand back and wait for you
Excuse me, Mrs. Busybody

As I would be free when you wanted me
If you wanted me, if you wanted me
I am the man on the side
Hoping you'll make up your mind
I am the one who will swallow his pride
Life as the man you know life as the man
Living life as the man on the side When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything
She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one cares
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hand
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away
Oh  about that
I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns
No, no, no, no, no
She comes and she goes
Like no one cares
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands
She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too Eat one and throw the rest away
Eat one and throw the rest away
When you live alone at Christmas-time
Your diet’s turnin’ on a dime
Eat one and throw the rest away
Eat one more then throw the rest away
Just eat one more then throw the rest away
(Come on)
Just eat one more, it couldn’t hurt
Tonight my dinner is dessert
Eat one more then throw the rest away
Rapidly eat as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Rapidly early as many as you can before you throw the rest away
Cause you don’t want to be fat for New Year’s
You just want to stand here above the garbage
And eat all of the ????? Away
Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Go back into the garbage for some you threw away
Tonight you know your diet’s wrecked
And you have got no self-respect
Go back into the garbage and (uhh uhh uhhhh)

No, you’re an adult, you can live with snacks
You might as well just try and put these back"
