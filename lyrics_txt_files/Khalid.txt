Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

Yeah, started off right
I can see it in your eyes
I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts (Yeah)
Can't get what we want without knowin' (No)
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

Oh, nah
Penthouse view, left some flowers in the room
I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?

Figure out where we're goin'

Figure out where we're goin' 2, 3, 4

The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do

I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do

I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere

But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over you As time passes, I feel so low
Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you

So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me

Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh

Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me

You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one
You weren't the one for me
So don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
No, don't come back to me, no
No, don't come back to me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me Na, na, na, na, ooh

Woke up a little too late this morning
But I think I'll be okay
I'll be okay
Damn, my car still smells like marijuana
My mom is gonna kill me
Gonna kill me
Traffic's backed up from corner to corner
So I guess I'll hit the highway
The highway
Shake away all the stress off my shoulders
Gonna have a good day
A good day

Because I'm eighteen
And I still live with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours are more understanding
I've never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
So let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do
It’s me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just me and you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Let's do all the stupid shit that young kids do

No I've never really been the smartest
Yeah I've made my mistakes
My mistakes
You were there when times were at their darkest
Always showing me the way
Lead the way
Your love seems to cut me deep, the sharpest
You'll always have a part of me
A part of me
Losing you has always been the hardest
I wish it were the old days (oh I wish it were the old days)

'Cause I was eighteen
And I still lived with my parents
Yeah they're not like yours
Well yours were more understanding
I never fell in love
I saved those feelings for you
When we did all the stupid shit that young kids do

It's me and you, ooh, ooh
Noooo....
Just me and you, ooh, ooh Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be

All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do)
Nowhere like I do (Do, do, do) Llévame a ciudad del sol

I-I send you a lot of, a lot of hugs
And, I hope to see you very soon Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride

Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded (I'm so faded)
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking

From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen

My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen (American teen)
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American

So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American (American dream)
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen
American teen (American teen)

American Teenager
And I'll be living this dream with you

We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American Something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

I don't mean to come off aggressive (no)
I'm just here to pass off the message (yeah)
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time

Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy

I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala

Lalalalalala

I hope I made the impression
That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to

'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

I'm not one for relationships

I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala
I'm fiendin' off, fiendin' off you
Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
Lalalalalala I'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada

I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better

Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku
[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now? I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no

They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels

Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
Angels Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?

There's millions of reasons to love you (Love you)
There's millions of reasons (Reasons, ooh)
You give me a reason to want you (Want you)

Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (Reason)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise

Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you

Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason (You give me a reason) Cold blooded, cold blooded

The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong

I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine

And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes (see it in your eyes)
That you're no good for me
And love is blind

Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch

Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got

I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind

Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded

Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm)
Cold blooded, cold blooded (mmmm) Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately
I wanna leave the extra all behind, mmm
And I know that you wanna be my baby, mmm yeah

Oh my, my, my

My bad, my bad
Alright Are we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)
But the seasons come and go (They go)
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?

Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come

Criticized, who am I to give up? (Who am I?)
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up

Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

Eyes low, eyes low

She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso

But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso

But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

If you climb in my car, then we're here all night, ooh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

21s sittin' on my M5 (Yeah)
Ride around summer, all-wheel-drive, yeah
Couple blunts in and I got my windows down
Lookin' real nice in my passenger side

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'

Ooh, don't you forget about me
Ooh, don't forget about me, yeah

Two-step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah

Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget

Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, ""Why'd you two part ways?""
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire

Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, ""Why'd you two part ways?""
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue Remix, baby, yeah

I meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

Drop me a pin, let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're callin' it
Whatever we're fallin' into
'Cause I don't really care about rules (Rules)
I don't really care about rules (Rules)
I just really care about you (You)
I'm enjoyin' starin' into (To)
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch, but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise, we got this, we got this
Baby just send me your

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)
Nothing else, but you

Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride
I don't need nothing else but you
(I don't need nothing else but you)
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride.... tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
But you, but you
Nothing else but you
But you
(Remix, baby)
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, I don't need nothing else but you You'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts

I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion

I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'

Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
That made me feel like I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're sitting in a car and just holding hands Roses were your favorite flower
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends

You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo…

You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive

Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo Mmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright

Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving (Oh yeah)
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience (Yeah, yeah)
Blood and cologne on the fragrance (Mmm, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is (Oh no)

So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love

So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached

'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck

Yeah (I'm in love with bad luck)
Bad, bad luck Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I’ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place (Mmm, nah)
It’s crowded
In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you’re down, I could show you around
If you’re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it’s cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time

So bring it, so bring it back (So bring it, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)
So bring it, so bring it (Nah)

So bring it, so bring it back
So bring it, so bring it (Yeah)

We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right I've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain

I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now

I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections

Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun We were running onto something
And we didn't say ""forever,"" but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out

We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out

We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go

So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah

Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spirit Take me 'round the world and back again
As I'm searching for my soul out there
Oh, there's something that I'm wondering (Yeah)
Where I'm going when my story ends

Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (Only getting older)
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (On my mind all the time)

Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me

So I'ma light it up, I'm gettin high (So high)
Ask me how I am, I'm getting by (Getting by by the minute)
But I'm thankful that I'm still alive (Alive)
'Cause there's so much more I'm left to find

Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (Only getting older)
Doesn't even matter anyway, no, we're
Focused and I'm coping with the pain, yeah, we're
Only getting older by the day, yeah, we're
Only getting older (On my mind all the time)

Keeps me up all night
Keeps me
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up (Up all night)
Keeps me up all night
Keeps me (Up)
Get these thoughts that keep me up all night
Keeps me up (Up all night)

On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time
Keepin' me up all night
On my mind all the time, ah

Keeps me up all night
Keeps me Life is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory

'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today

Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we’re going, gotta be prepared
We’ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don’t live what they preach (Live what they preach)
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free

'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
(Yeah, and I won't be waiting on you)
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give up, no no)
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah

You gotta take it slow (Alright)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
You gotta take it slow (Oh)
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)

'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face

Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don’t need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive I feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline
Though I never had you, I used to pretend that you're mine
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
Bruising my finger hitting your line
If I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind (So alone)

Keeping my phone alive (Alive)
Hoping that you call this time (Oh, I)
Thought I heard your ringing (You)
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend

Keepin' you on my radar
Lately, you're so damn cold
You used to hold me down
You're far, so it's been a while
I still remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the morning
You're the only one I'm wanting
Love stays still and I'm frozen
But I'm opening thoughts that I keep within
I guess I gotta be a man
I tried as hard as I can

Keeping my phone alive (You)
Hoping that you call this time
Thought I heard you ringin'
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend (Come alive, oh yeah)
Show me, don't pretend (Yeah, yeah)
Show me, don't pretend Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me

It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you (I can't)
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldn’t have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth

Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me
(Say you don't want me, yeah)
We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to
(We don't gotta be no more)
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
(Just say you don't want me, yeah)
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, no So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could

But we still got love to give (Uncle Jxm, aye)

I didn't finish college, so my momma thought I wouldn't be shit
I had to prove her wrong (yah)
That's why I talk about her now in every single song
Had to struggle for a while (I did)
Just so I could live it up when it's time to live (ok)
I knew something had to give (yah)
Broke as hell using Lyft (why?)

Told everyone I turned my phone off
Didn't ask for help and now I’m lost
Life comes in phases (Phases)
Consequences and mistakes
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long

Mister, mister, please let off your power
Give me half an hour, or better yet, a full
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it, and then there’s more to lose

Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim Reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive

Here's the thing with disappearing
You can yell and no one hears you
Times like this, I need an ear
When I finally have so much to say
Wish I could see your face, oh
And do what I have to stop the tears

Sister, sister, please know that I'm sorry
I wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it until it gets too real

Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life

Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away

Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends

Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and I’ve been, too
And no-one knows what you’ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much

Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away

Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends (Overthink)

Yeah, yeah Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say, I’m giving up
And I've been losing count

When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight

Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while

Nahh, All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out

When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah

Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason

Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
'Cause I care (I care), I care about you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here around you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
I care (I care), care about you (Care about you)
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be

With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do, I do, oh (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah) My ride or die
Let’s burn out tonight
Even if we don’t survive
We were right by being wrong
Don’t look back to the wreck
Stay with me, turn your head
This is it, all that's left
Just some times that we had, oh

Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

Ooh, ooh

And now the way you say
My name sounds like a song
That you've been singing all along
Don’t forget it once I'm gone

Oh, Heaven (Heaven), make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here (Oh)
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

Heaven (Hey), make me an offer (Oh)
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here (Yeah)
Heaven, if you come over (Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah)
Oh, I know how to make us disappear

Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here You just turned 21, so lately, you've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight the feeling
Thinking 'bout letting go, would that be easy for you then? Yeah
So lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers
Stay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving
All of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin (Oh, oh)

'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright, alright

Don't believe everything
The shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally
I see you smiling when you say you need privacy
You're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh
I say I'm fine, coming home
I see the sun come up and shut the blinds
Episodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong
But I can't do it by myself, oh

'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends

Yeah, alright (Alright)
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight

'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame
To end this fight, I have to change

Yeah, alright
Hold on tight
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight Taking off, turn off the lights
We're so in denial of breaking up, we make it up
Every time I look in your eyes, I’m back in love

I've waited all my life, for someone like you
But I'm losing sight of your point of view

Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we’re both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

It's no one's fault, that's what they say
You want it your way, you know it all
We said its no one's fault, losing our minds
Lie after lie, fake love

We had a hell of a ride
Issues aside, both of us

Are we broken? Lost in emotion (Lost in the moment)
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we're both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?

Are you, mmm, ooh
Are you, oh So, this is gonna be one take!
One, two, three, four

I walk, I walk, I see the light
I push, I fall, and all of my life
I search for my love, I cannot find
A love like yours, as hard as I've tried
Lay by my side just for the night
This isn't love but it feels right
I must admit I cry at nights
I'm stuck on you and I don't know why

You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?

I don't know why I feel like this
At times I don't think I can handle it
I don't know why I feel so low
You were the one who kept me whole
You chew me up then spit me out
You stole the words right out my mouth
You fed me with ""I love you""s
I don't know why I'm stuck

You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you? I think I'm fearful of things like traveling
I'm fearful of failure
I'm fearful of being embarrassed
Things like that, I think hinder me from doing the best that I can sometimes
But I think that if I learn to be less fearful
I would get further
I feel like I'm not always in the correct direction
Even though I know I'm on the right path
I'm like ""I'm on the right path""
But am I walking the right way, or should I be turning around?
Like little things like that that I go back and forth about in my head
And I think it's always nice to have reassurance
I think it's really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you
For me at least, like I think that's the reason that I am where I am
I think that I am a big mix of all the people around me
And I'm just happy
I can't complain about anything
Oh yeah
That I'm trying to get so motherfucking high, nigga
I don't wanna feel nothing (Wait, what?) The people of El Paso Texas proudly present

Forever, from the city of the 915
*Cheers and applause* Would you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you?

I've got a girl on my way and she looks like Rihanna
Babygirl, I'm legit, I'd probably wife up your momma
Catch me rolling to the spot in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like designer
Netflix and chillling so get out of your feelings
If you never do business, leave the building
I want a bad girl with a little bit of class
Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past
1, 2, 3 to the 4
Counting down the time until our bodies hit the floor
Just a young dude, don't know why i'm feeling you
But i don't want a relation so

Work them heels and you graduated college, got a job last year
Bad pretty black chick, bad with her friends, with her new man in the back of a black Benz
Got new dreams and you mean with the jeans
Watchu mean, watchu say, watchu mean what I say?
Doublin' up your worth, whatchu want from the boy?
Runnin' to get the ring and I told all my boys
So, pack up the aunties, pack up the nieces
Call all your nephews, hit up my tika
Tell her that I can't come around no mo'
When the sun don't shine round the year no more
Northside hitter ain't in the north no more
And I ain't going back to being broke no more, ah
Real shit, I'mma keep with the boys
I'mma keep words soft
Fuck it homie, roll dat dope shit
Baby let me, then I grow shit
Glowed up, got me fitted like a glow stick
Uh, but that's okay 'cause I'ma dance through the pain
No addition like a stamp through the brain, you know what I'm sayin' yuh

Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might be a little late
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into

Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations

Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into (Trouble to get into)

Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's go Ready?
I can't get this thing to stop squeaking
Laughs
Alright
Ready, Riley?
Ready
1, 2, 3, 4

I've been on my own for a long time, I'm feelin' kinda lonely
Nothing's fun when I'm the only one out here who knows me
Something's stopping me from becoming a better person
I could try to pace myself, but I don't think that it's worth it

What's the point in workin', if a wish is never certain?
I know I'll never be... perfect

I went for a walk last night, I swear it was for hours
Happiness is far from reachin' inside of my power
My friends say that I'm changin', changin' like the weather
Mom says I look sick, pop says keep my head up

What's the point in workin', if a wish is never certain?
I know I'll never be... perfect

Man, I'm thinking out loud, where I know someone will hear me
Cryin' out for help, in search of someone near me
And I see a growin' boy whenever I look in the mirror
Told me pain is temporary and my vision's comin' clearer

I'm not used to workin', a wish is never certain
I know I'll never be... perfect

No, no
I'm not used to workin', a wish is never certain
But at least I'll never be... perfect Uh, it's a win baby
Feels like something's missing, where you been lately?
Tryna tell myself that I ain't in too deep
Give me all of you, and take all of me
This is more than we
How the time flies, know I got my ways about me
Always into mind's eyes, see you sold it to me
Mommy told me he's a nice guy
Know you've got your ways about you too
This is new to me, is this new to you?

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you (I don't need nothing else but you)

I don't wanna fall in love off of sub-tweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night and

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through (Place to come through)

Oh, you say it's all you need
So you can take control and baby, I'll follow your lead
You say it's best to plan it through, well boy I don't agree
The best things happen unplanned, a result of you and me
This is more than they can teach
Meet me somewhere off the map
I share my location with no one else so don't be late
It's undecided it will determine our fate
Boy would you mind if we continued this off in space?
Earth has never been it for me
All of what I'm envisioning isn't just what the eye can see
Or what the mind can read
Balance is just balance, ying and yang
I'll hold you down if you're here for the madness
Nothing's ever straightforward, but I'm sure that we can manage
I say I'm calm and collected, you say it's passive aggressive
What's with the fightin' and stressin'
I'm not here for that, neither are you, it's not what we do
Maybe I'm just missing your touch, you should come through
Yeah, yeah

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you Got my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you climb in my car, then we're here all night, ooh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high

If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

Lost track of time
If I'm waitin' on love, I'll be waitin' all night
I can't get this high from nowhere else
And I'm tryin' to let you go, but it's all alright
I know I can't stay up on my feelings when I'm with you
I know, I admit it, I'm addicted when I'm with you
Whenever I'm with with you

Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin' (Ah)
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?

Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'

Don't you forget about me
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
If I'm the only one that you're
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin', usin'?
Don't you forget about me

Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

Send me wherever you were writin'
Send to me whatever you've been thinkin' 'bout
Won't be surprised if I'm feelin' the same way that you do
I'm a stranger to this all
Not a stranger to the fall
I just wish you wouldn't mind to call me back, no

Send me your location, let's
Focus on communication
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through, no
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you

Should I throw in the towel or throw you vowels?
I've been, constantly tryin' to track you down
Smiley, I'm skin and teeth 'cause your skinnin' out
Give me neck, your neck'll spin like an owl, I'll spin you 'round
I.e., I felt your presence upon your entrance
They need attention, you need affection
My only sentence, I'll leave you breathless
If you're guilty that's a life full of diamonds without the pressures
And raccoon, you're in my circle, that's eternal, we're in the loop
Your ex is cussin', he's supposed to, that's an excuse
That's what they do... I follow through

So send me your location
'Cause I want your vibrations and frequencies
Only trees and seeds

I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you You've got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we can make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Anyplace is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I've got nothing to prove

You've got a fast car
I've got a plan to get us outta here
I've been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

See my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle that's the way it is
Says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
Said somebody's gotta take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
I've got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bars
See more your friends than you do your kids
I always hoped for better
That maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulders and
I-I had a feeling that I belonged
And I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You've got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You've gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
This way, yeah-eah-eah-eah, -eah

I can tell that you're wantin' more
What's been on your mind?
There's no reason we should hide
Tell me somethin' I ain't heard before

Oh, I've been dreamin' 'bout it
And it's you I'm on
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'

The time will pass, that I know
Love will grow like a wildflower

Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower

Pull me in, then get close
Feel your heartbeat on mine
Where have you been? I've waited long
But now you're here, right on time
When it’s safe, they will pour
Who'll like to see you cry?
Take your hand, hold on mine
Love will burn like a wildflower (Love will burn)

Like a wildflower (Love will burn)
Like a wildflower (It's about to burn)
Like a wildflower (It's about to burn) Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
'Cause I live down the street so we meet when you need it, it's yours
All I hear is

Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
         So you're still thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young dumb broke high school kids
We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment?
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
While we're young dumb
Young, young dumb and broke
Young dumb Será que é melhor apenas acreditar
Nas teorias que a ignorança nós trás?
Queria que a vida fosse facíl (Mhm)
Mas a minha é uma confusão
Eles falam que é por causa das estações do ano(Mhm)
Mas as estações vão passando (Elas estão passando)
Tudo fica confuso quando eu reflito
Sou eu ou a vertigem?

Criticado, quem sou eu para desistir?
E respirar é o unico motivo para viver
Simpatizar, quem sou eu para desistir
Tocando meu disco favorito?

Estamos vivendo?
Ou estamos sonhando?
Depois da jornada
Você está vivendo?
Estamos vivendo?
Ou estmaos sonhando?
Depois da journada
Você esta vivendo?

Ja estive melhor, muitas vezes quebrado
Ja apanhei e passei por batalhas
Eu queria ser mais sincero
Mas não consigo adquirir palavras para me expressar
Hmm, achava que eu te amava naquele momento
Eu estava feliz, mas não estava
Eu estou aprendendo, Eu tou crescendo
Mas o pior estar por vim

Criticado, quem sou eu para desistir?
E respirar é o unico motivo para viver
Simpatizar, quem sou eu para desistir
Tocando meu disco favorito?

Estamos vivendo?
Ou estamos sonhando?
Depois da jornada
Você está vivendo?
Estamos vivendo?
Ou estmaos sonhando?
Depois da journada
Você esta vivendo?

Olhos fechados, olhos fechados
Estou caindo com meus

Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are

I'm on the other side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark

Ooh yeah (felt my feet leave the ground)
Your back against the wall, this is all we've been talkin' about
In my ears

Nothin' feels better than this (no, no, no)
Nothin' feels better
Nothin' feels better than this
