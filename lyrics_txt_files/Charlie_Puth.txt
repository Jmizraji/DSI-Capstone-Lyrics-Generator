What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore Alright
Ooh, yeah

Can't you blame my head and not my heart?

'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now (yeah)

When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unravellin'
And girl, it's drivin' me insane
There's no road worth travellin'

You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now

Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out (oh, baby)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now This is gonna hurt, but I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off of that love, it fucked my head up
There’s no forgetting you

You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you’re the train and I’m tied to the track

You’ve awoken me, but you’re choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly, I got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know, there’s only one place this could lead
But you are the fire, I’m gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you

I loved you dangerously
Ooh, more than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn’t care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh baby, I loved you dangerously

Mmmm, mmmm
Ooh, I loved you dangerously
Ooh-ooh, I loved you dangerously It started with a kiss
On your mama's couch
2012 was nothing serious
And then we caught the feels
It got really real
Too good to be true
I guess I thought you was, yeah

Why did I run away, run away, run away?
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

Thought I could get you back any time of day
Shouldn't have been so cocky
Shouldn't have did you wrong (Woah)
And now I miss you bad, really, really bad
Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone

Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)
Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (Everything)
I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late (Gettin' late)
But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah

I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
(You said it too, baby)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new (Ooh)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

Baby, no, oh, cheating on you
Baby, no
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

Baby, no
There ain't no lips like your lips
And nobody else feels like this
There's no moving on, I'll admit
If you go away, yeah

I know I said goodbye and, baby, you said it too
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Cheating on you)
I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new
(Found someone new)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you
(Believe it, baby)

Baby, no, oh, cheating on you (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)
Baby, no (I said goodbye, but I'm still in love)
But when I touch her, I feel like I'm cheating on you

These mistakes, I’ve made my fair share
When you needed me, I wasn’t there
I was young, I was dumb, I was so immature
And the things that I did made you so insecure
But baby, I’m still your man, I swear

Please be patient with me
Please be patient with me
I know I’m not what you need
But baby, I’m gonna be
So please be patient with me

Is it too much (Is it too much?) that I’m asking for?
Can we start over? (Can we start over?) Can we end this war?
I’ve been taking your love, I’ve been wasting your time
But is there still a chance of me changing your mind?
Before you (yeah) go walking out the door

Oh, you know I’m not perfect
If you leave, I deserve it
But baby, all I’m asking you is please, please (Oh)

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Why'd you have to leave so soon, yeah?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?
'Cause I don't know really how to tell you without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place but it's always gonna hurt

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

How do I breathe without you? I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waitin' right here for you 'till the day you're home

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you told me I don't have to worry?
""He's overseas, out on his tour, he'll be okay without me""
You said you had nothing to hide, that you left him long ago
I shoulda known that was a lie

I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
I warned myself that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

Do you remember when you said, ""Do not tell anybody
'Cause if ya do, I'll be the first to put my hands around your throat""?
If you had nothing to hide, why is no one s'posed to know?
I shoulda known that was a lie

I (I) warned myself (Warned myself) that I shouldn't play with fire (Oh no)
But I can tell (I know) that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why
I warned myself (Warned myself) that I shouldn't play with fire
But I can tell (I can tell) that I'll do it one more time
Don't trust in myself, (Mmm) no good for my health (Mmm)
You messed with my heart, now you're the reason why

The reason why I got these girls tryna lock me down
And I always up and leave
But for the first time in a while
I wanna throw away the key
And I know you've been in a couple more relationships than me
'Cause you talk a different talk
And you kiss me differently

Now I don't know where to go
After you loved me this way
After you loved me so good
How are you gonna tell me you don't wanna stay?

You tell me I'm too young, but
I gave you what you wanted
Baby, how dare you treat me just like
Like a boy

Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change

Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around
What a waste, another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can’t we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can’t we just get along?

What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing?
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same

Why can’t we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah

We don’t have to go that way
Not today

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do

Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo (Back of the Benzo)
More than a friend zone (More than a friend zone)

I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love

Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over

Girl, you gotta slow it down (Girl, you gotta slow it down)
I can't give it all to you

But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, ""Who is that, babe?""
And the way you said, ""Nobody""
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one

Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it
You were my girl
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't adding up
But I just go blind when you look into my eyes
Every time that I try to confront you (To confront you)
There's always somewhere you gotta run to (Gotta run to)
The warning signs
They were more than just warning signs

Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love (You were half in love)

You wanna go upstairs but you don't wanna sleep
Oh, right now we're in a rhythm
Your boyfriend's no competition
Turn off your phone and blame it on your battery (Hey!)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
We're getting real, real close
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can't let this moment go

Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups
If you wanna like I wanna
Let me take you to another room
So it's only us
Turn that television up so nobody can listen
Hands on your body like there's no one at the party
Just me and you and these empty cups

Oh, girl, do you think they'll notice if we slip away?
Maybe tomorrow they'll all have something to say

Tired of this conversation
We didn't come all this way
To touch a little, kiss a little
All night long
You wanna hear me say it
I know I kept you waitin'
Just a little, just a little
All night long

Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop
But I think I'll do it anyway

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official

Don't we look perfect, baby?
Let's take this further, baby
Just a little, just a little
All night long
If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
Not just a little, just a little
All night long

Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop (Oh)
But I think I'll do it anyway

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend? (Oh)

Hold on, you're makin' me (Oh no, baby, my)
My girlfriend (Yeah) You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young
The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay
I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break (Yeah)
I've already fell so many times, but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

Growing up in this wild city, you had to fight or run
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, I've been through it all
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, oh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all I should have told you how I really feel
A little in advance
Then I would’ve had some time to go and work it out
I think I’ve lost my chance

For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you’d figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face
Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you’d ever say ""goodbye""
If I didn’t say it first

I’m done playing these games
I can’t believe what I’m about to say
I won’t tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

No, no more nights
Drink until my loneliness
Up till two A.M
No, no more waiting
Pacing 'round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in

For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you’d figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face
Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you’d ever say ""goodbye""
If I didn’t say it first

I’m done playing these games
I can’t believe what I’m about to say
No, I won’t tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind

Ooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh

I’m done playing these games
I can’t believe what I’m about to say
'Cause I would rather die than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No, I would rather die than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind When I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone (Whoa, oh)
Every single moment will be faded into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you (Whoa, oh)
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When we're old and gray (Yeah)
And our faces changed (Whoa, oh)
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love (Listen)
And every story ends
But we could still pretend (Yeah, yeah)
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby
That's some type of love
That's some type of love

When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love Tell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake

And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie

Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?

Girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?

Again and again, that's always bae

I'm only one call away I’d stroll into a bank and put a ski mask on
And walk out with a million bucks
Then I’d burn it in a pile out on your front lawn
Just to prove it didn't mean that much
I’d sell everything I own, took a pile of cash
Walk into the casino, bet it all on black
Then blow all of my winnings on a limousine
To make out with you in the back, hey

I’m not afraid to look insane
'Cause I’m crazy about ya

There’s nothing that I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me, baby
I know I’m all but shameless
Just need you and I could care less
If everyone knows that I'm your fool
Girl, there's nothing I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me (Hey)

I’d buy a couple red-eye one-way tickets
To Paris to our first class ride
Then I’d carry your body to the top of the tower
To kiss your lips at midnight
Then we’ll wander through the streets and drink champagne
Get drunk and start singing in the pouring rain
I’ll acapella karaoke “Sexy Thing”
'Cause baby, I feel no shame
Say this whole world can know you’re all I need
'Cause baby, some day, I’ll drop and hit one knee and tell ya

I’m not afraid to change your name
'Cause I’m crazy about ya

There’s nothing that I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I’m all but shameless
Just need you and I could care less
If everyone knows that I’m your fool
Girl, there’s nothing I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me (Hey)

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Throw myself out of a jet air plane
Hundred feet a second, just screaming your name
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I'd steal a cop car, turn the blue lights on
Pick you up and drive it around ‘til dawn

I’m not afraid to look insane
'Cause I’m crazy about ya
Oh, oh, oh I’m not afraid to look insane
'Cause I’m crazy, crazy, crazy

There’s nothing that I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me
Throw away my pride for you
Just to make you love me, want me, trust me
Baby, I know I’m all but shameless
Just need you and I could care less
If everyone knows that I’m your fool
Girl, there’s nothing I won’t do
Just to make you love me, love me, love me, baby I said this time next year
I'ma be the one who do
Everything and more you said
I couldn't do
This one is for you
This time next year
I'm gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now

'Cause this time next year
I'ma walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see
Gonna see me
And I'ma call every girl that turned me down
And tell 'em now that
I'm just too busy
'Cause I don't have the time
And it's funny how my so-called friends
Who've always left me alone
Are suddenly running into me
And blowin' up my phone

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh baby
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh, look at me now

Woah, this one is dedicated
To all of the people
Who said I would be nothing
Just look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now

I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now Mmm, mmm, mmm

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just keep it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me?
Did he watch you fall asleep?
Did he show you all the things that you used to do to me?
Then you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Baby, don't come back to me
Oh, oooh, oh

Baby don't come back to me, yeah
Oh, oooh, oh
No I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Oooh, ooooh, ooooh I'm run, yeah, oh yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind

It's funny how I got just exactly what I want
I'll try to have fun some other time
I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush
I'll try to go find some other high

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
But I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

So much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind

I'm sorry that I'm not there to give you what you want
I'll think about us some other time
And I'm sorry that I can't be the perfect type of man
I'll think about us some other time

Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road

I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind
I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind Thinkin' back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days, baby, you were the truth
And nothing you could do will ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts, girl, forget what they do
But somewhere down the line, I left you hanging

For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I’ll never break your heart again

'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are

You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing, more nothing less, you’re the real
I wanna take this time to thank you, baby

For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I’ll never break your heart again

'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you (I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you (I could never judge you)
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are

So let it be known now
The queen on my throne now
It’s you at all times
I’ll never reject you
I’ll love and respect you
'Cause you’re my lifeline
Only thing on my wish list
You love and forgiveness
For that, I will climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Why would I fight it?
I know that it’s right when you’re holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I’ll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I’m yours
You know that I’m yours

'Cause I, I will always love you (I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you (I could never judge you)
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you (Darling, I will always love you)
(I will always love you)
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are Well, I get a thrill from down my spine
When I see you hittin' me up
Feelin' so electrified
Like the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
'Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on

Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry Ohh, ooh

Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed
Some girls be cravin' that attention to be seen
But the one I'm lookin' at is right in front of me

There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

Some girls, they hit me up sayin', ""What you doin' now?""
But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wonderin' why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me now

There's no words to express
When you're wearin' that dress that way
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's no words to describe
Let me look in your eyes and say
Oh-oh

There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you

Oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
There's beautiful, and then there's you, yeah
Oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh
There's beautiful, and then there's you
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo-hoo

Some girls walk in the room and everything remains
But when you opened up the door, my life completely changed

There's beautiful, and then there's you, oh
There's beautiful, and then there's you
(Did you know you're beautiful, baby?)
There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
There's beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you
I know there is beautiful, and then there's you

There's beautiful, and then there's you Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just don't feel right
Every time one of us tries to leave here
Oh, the other one holds on tight, oh, oh
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us but you say
You gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

You tell me someone's waiting for ya
That you can't do this anymore
But you kiss me again
So go ahead and draw the blinds and lock all the doors
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul

Oh, if you want me like I want you
I won't judge you, this could be our little secret (secret)
Our secret (secret)
So tell me if you're ready
Cause if no one knows then it ain't really cheating

Oh, darling, I know you're taken
Something 'bout this just feels so right
Cause every time one of us
Tries to justify the situation, we just hold on tighter, oh, oh
Baby, tonight, there's so much
Love in between us you say
That you gotta get home
Stay here with me
I won't tell a soul Oh, I've been hurtin' lately
I’m down on all my luck
Sometimes there’s no one there by your side
I don’t deserve this, baby
But I know I can’t give up
Tough times, I just take them in stride

Mmm, I’m almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, I’m movin' on, I got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

I said times are changin'
Tell me, how can I keep up?
Every time I turn around, there’s a wall
But I’m climbing daily, until I see the top
And I get up right after every fall
When you’re brokenhearted and you’re love's departed
Yeah, you gotta walk alone, yeah, it’s true
Flash every smile 'cause I’ve been lost for miles
'Cause yeah, I know you’ve felt this way before too

Mmm, we’re almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Mmm, we’re movin' on, we got no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we’re almost, there only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left

Mmm, I know it looks like it’s too far
But it’s nothing compared to how far we’ve come
Walking down this boulevard
When the darkest times come right before the sun

We’re almost there, baby, one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
We’re movin' forward and there’s no regrets
Whoa, left, right, left, right
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Woah, we’re almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left
Whoa, we’re almost there, only one more step
Whoa, left, right, left, right, left Woah-oah, hm-hmm

O-2-L They’ll never know just who you are
But they can’t turn your bright star dark
They'll try to hold your spirit down
Couldn't do it then, can't do it now
They'll try to tell you who to be
But they can't change the way you feel

Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free (Free), free (Free)

They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you wеre built too strong for that

Can't tame a wild heart

Free as thе grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free (Free)

Oh, no one's ever putting out that fire inside
Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back, running fast and free

Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free, yeah (Free), free, yeah (Free)

Free, free, free
Oh, free Detonate, detonator
Baby, oh, you blow my mind
You tell me wait, wait on ya
But baby, I can't wait all night
I go through pictures you send my phone
Oh, stop tempting me
You know what I want
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over, whoa
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

So, here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Well, baby, don't wear nothing else
When I open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man gon' make you feel the same
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer
So...

Smile when you're talking to me
I don't wanna know your real pain
Long nights, I don't know your real name
Soft kiss when the yellow cab came
Til the next time when the sun fall
And my thoughts roam and the love calls
For your soft tone and your sweet talk
And your dial tone when you're not bothered
Hoping feelings never get brought up
Conversation never get broad
Still blind by the street lights
Never gonna let another man cross
Yes, I understand
Baby, loosen up your pants
Staring at me from your knees
Birds and the fucking bees

I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer Lyrics from a snippet
You stress me out
You used to calm me down
But now I'm going, going, going out my mind
You stress me out
You used to calm me down
But now I'm going, going, going out my mind
You stress If, I'm gonna fall
Will you promise me I'll always have a kingdom?
'Cause I, I have it all
But you're taking everything I ever dreamed of

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I know too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If, I had a choice
I suppose I'd have to do it all over
'Cause when, I hear your voice
Part of me just wants to be a little closer

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I know too well

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
You're not who you said you were
Oh, woah woah
I'm feeling the doubt
Your face is just one big blur

If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy

If I don't
Breathe a little
If I don't
Breathe a little We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore (We don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore (We don't, we don't)
What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

(We don't talk anymore)
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
The way I did before
(We don't talk anymore)
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game (Oh)
Now I can't get you out of my brain (Woah)
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore Stole my heart and I fell for you
Always knew I'd come back for you
Time with you is not wasted time
Hurry for confection
Waiting for perfection
What I got to do to make you mine?

Oh woah
Something about your hope
It’s making me want to know
How far I can take it
Oh woah
Don’t want to take it slow
Just give it another go and
We can

Put myself through hell for you
Loving you's my only sin
Cutting through the tension
That’s my only intention
Just trying to let you let me in

Oh woah
Something about your hope
It’s making me want to know
How far I can take it
Oh woah
Don’t want to take it slow
Just give it another go and

Five dollar (Five dollar)
Five dollar footlong (Specially made with veggies)
It's back (It’s back)
And yes that's (And yes that's)
Why I wrote this song
The good old days are back now, Tristan Okay
This is a song about how I used to get really scared around girls
And it goes like this

Won't you please let me
Back to your heart?
(Yeah, alright)
Won't you please let me (I'm gonna go in now, this is me going in)
(Here we go)
Back to your heart (Okay)

'04, seventh grade
High top Adidas and I thought I had game
But it turns out that I didn't and I learned the hard way
When I walked up to this girly and I asked her ""What's your name?""
She said ""Don't, stop! Why are you talking to me?
You're the new kid in town and you look like you're three
And it's easy to see by your pale-ass skin
That you're always home alone, McCauley Caulkin""
I need consultin' for all of my fears
'Cause I didn't have another girl for four more years
And they gave me every one of their gracing chances
Paid no attention to all their advances
But freshman in college I found my first love
And I took her out to dinner and I thanked the gods above
But when she went to give me a kiss had a pain in my stomach
Too much food, had to vomit
(Ugh, we should do this again sometime -- BLUGH)

(Ugh, I swear this never happens)
Won't you please let me
Back to your heart
(Oh baby please give me another chance! We could go to the good-house garden)
Won't you please let me (Yeah)
Back to your heart

Mike Ballz did it, oh!
Oh damn
These girls all assessing me
In a line-up, but they ain't selecting me
I'm too obedient and missing one ingredient
I need a little L-O-V-E up in this recipe (Yup)
But they say ""nice guys finish last""
So I gotta be an ass if I win my class
Nah, nope, I just can't do it
Maybe they'll be feeling me now I that make some music
Maybe not, I'll go right till I'm famous
Flaunt all of my swag, I'll snag me at A-list
Hey, Taylor Swift, are you feeling this?
Give a rapper a chance
Somebody make sure that she's hearing this
But I'm for real, shit, I just need a chance
Seventh grade girls were laughing at me when I ripped my pants
I'm no Brad Pitt or George Clooney
But I'm a real dude that can make your life feel like a movie

(Well, uh, probably a low budget movie, actually)
Won't you please let me (Yeah)
Back to your heart (With… With a lot less special effects)
(But, it'll be really cool)
Won't you please let me
(You probably wouldn't die in the end)

Ladies, this your chance
(Grape jam)
Put up your hands
(Or any other body part)
Wave 'em side to side
Let's ride
(Eh, that was lame)
Yeah
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Charlie Puth, baby
It's Mike Ballz, and Charlie Puth (oh no)
We're chilling up in that booth
(John Wilkes)
But it's not really a booth
'Cause it's just in his living room
(Very convenient)
It's right next to the kitchen
(Uh)
Yo, Charlie, what you dishing?
(Domino's Pizza)
Do you watch the dishes (Won't you please let me)
(Nah)
'Cause you got some dishes in your sink
That sucks
Wash your dishes, son
Boom!
(Charlie Puth, bitch) Charlie
You know what it is
When you hear that, heh!
Montana

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, ""Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

She said ""Boy, tell me honestly""
""Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies""
""Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady

Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Charlie
Oooh-ooh-oh
You know what it is
Ayy, Montana

P-p-pull up to the club in four Lambos
Shorty tryin' to rip off the door handle
If you ain't known that, you know now
Shorty Olivia when it come to scandals
T-top down, t-top down
Fell in love with the pennys in the top down
Shorty tryin' to creep and I can't stand it
Creep, creepin' through the window like what man
Talking to herself goin' crazy
French vanilla got us both going crazy
I-I don't know what you thought
I don't wanna hear I'm sorry, my fault
How long has this been goin' on?
Montana

How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

(Ooo-oh, yeah)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
You've been creepin' 'round on me
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh
(Ooo-oh)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
(You gotta go tell me now)
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby Girl sitting right down here
Where it's not so crowded
He sees you looking but he's not doing anything about it
Baby you're looking
In the wrong direction
'Cause this friction between us
Is just straight perfection
(Why you playing hard to get?)

Oooh oooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Oooh oooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute

If we were in the dark
If we-we-we-we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we-we were in the daaark
Daaark
We were in the dark
Dark-dark-dark-dark
(We-we-we, we were, we were)

She's spending every other night alone
'Cause all them other guys are blowing up her phone
But she really doesn't know
How good it could be
If she rearranged her plans
And made them with me
I'm not into pressing by butt?
But your sexy little body has got me stuck
And I know there's something that I miss
But before I go on, let me tell you this

Oooh oooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Oooh oooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute

If we were in the dark
If we-we-we-we were in the dark (dark) woah
If we-we were in the daaark
Daaark

Wanna have you to myself
Oooh oooh

Dark-dark-dark-dark
We-we-we-we were in the dark
If we-we-we-we were in the dark (dark) woa-woah
If we-we were in the -
If we were in the -
If we were in the dark
Dark-dark-dark-dark
We-we-we-we were in the dark Does it feel different? Or like it was?
Does he ever send you roses just because
And would he hold you?
All through the night?
Write a half a million songs to make it right

There's no place that I'd rather be
Than when you're here right, next to me

Oooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?

How many times would
He say goodbye?
All he ever seems to do is make you cry
Do you still think of me
Every single day?
Cause our life was comfortable in every way

There's no place that I'd rather be
Than when you're here right, next to me

Oooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?

Woah
Why you gotta do me like that?
Woah
You make me say, yeah
You make me say

Oooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?
Oooh, is he really gonna love you
Or just let you go? (just let you go)
Baby no-oh, does he really mean it
When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit? I gotta have you now, it's not an option
You're taking off your blouse and I'm watching you
In front of your mirror, you turn the curtain down
I couldn't be any clearer what we're gonna do now

I wanna see you riding and grinding and
We're gonna get it right we're colliding
We're gonna have to keep quiet tryna keep it down
You're tearing off my shirt for another go round

For another go round
For another go round

I gotta have you now, just can't take it
I wanna put you down when we're faded
And at the top of your lungs, you'll be screaming my name
And we've gone too far to go the other way

I'll pick you up and lay you on the kitchen counter
Said you couldn't do without it, I'm okay if you're about it
Down in every direction, got me hypnotized
I'm hallucinating, going out of my mind

For another go round
For another go round
For another go round

It's like every other evening, let me see what you can do
Yeah, I got all this paper, let me throw it all on you

For another go round
For another go round
For another go round We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before

Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

This goes out to the one and only Miss Mysterious
The thought of being next to her has got me so delirious

Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?

Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever feel the same?
Never been acquainted
I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
'Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have ever thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
'Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true?
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?
(Oooh)
Just tell me if you're out there, if you're out there

Oh oh woah
No no no no no no no no no
Oh oh woah
No no no no no no no no no Ohh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Right next to you
Next to you

You're the kind of person I remember seeing before
Your pretty face is one that I'll always adore
You have the eyes that'll close whenever you kiss me
Because love makes us whatever we want to be

How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With, you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're in front of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you

When I saw you on that richside on that one particular day
I was really hoping and wondering if you'd ever look my way
So I got up from my seat but you had already passed me by
If only I got there earlier and not lost in your eyes

How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With, you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're in front of me

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you

I'll promise one day I'll be
And maybe one day you'll see
That you belong to me
Baby, baby
I don't know what to do
And it only helps when I'm sitting right next to you
Sitting right next to you

When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do

Da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Right next to you
Da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Right, next to you The stone thrown at your window
It's telling you to get up and get up and go
And to climb down the shakers of your house
To the back of my Chevy and no one will ever know

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if we can't find one backseat's gonna be our bed

Oh Melanie I don't believe
When you tell me that
You're seventeen and proud
'Cause you said it so loud
It's not right to hold you through the night
You put up no fight when I put words in your mouth
Oooh, yeah

We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if we can't find one backseat's gonna be our bed

She ripped off the grass and threw it on my face
I pushed her over laughing right away
She said the moonlight makes the windows in your eyes
Kiss her inside out with no goodbye, bye

I remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
It's not right but oh I can't fight it anymore
Do you remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
Oh it's not right yeah
I can't fight it anymore
I can't fight
I can't fight it anymore Well I’m crying and I’m dying
’Cause I really thought that you would be the one
And I tried to stand beside you
But it was over way before it had begun
I like to think it’s all okay
And one day you’ll come back and stay with me
Come and stay with me

But now you’re gone (but now you're gone)
And I don’t know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don’t wanna hear no love songs
And I don’t wanna see you at all
’Cause I can’t afford to have my heart break again
I just thought that maybe you’d change
But you’re still the same, the same, the same
As you were back then
I’ve had enough (I've had enough)
Enough of you (enough of you)
And I won’t let you break my heart again

Lately, every day now
I go to bed and sleep my life away till four
’Cause I don’t know (’cause I don’t know)
What it feels like (what it feels like)
To not wake up and run a mile right to your door

You’re still gone
And I don’t know if I can carry on (carry on)

I don’t wanna hear no love songs
And I don’t wanna see you at all
’Cause I can’t afford to have my heart break again
I just thought that maybe you’d change
But you’re still the same, the same, the same
As you were back then
I’ve had enough (I've had enough)
Enough of you (enough of you)
And I won’t let you break my heart again

Why you gotta break my heart again?
And I can’t keep holding on (can’t keep holding on)

I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don’t wanna see you at all
’Cause my heart’s gonna break again
I’ve had enough (I've had enough)
Gave it my all (gave it my all)
Just thought you changed (just thought you'd changed)
But I was wrong
And now that you’re gone (now that you’re gone)
You can’t break my heart again, again
Can’t break my heart again Yeah, yeah
See I’ve been thinkin’ lately, baby
I don’t wanna hurt you baby, no more

I see you walking over there with all your friends
Eyein’ me down
But remember what you said to me, to me
We’ve been on and off for a couple months now
Feeling okay ’bout it all
But baby somehow
You keep coming back to me (leave me)

The last thing I wanna do is leave again and end up bringing you down
And you can’t just come around
I don’t wanna keep playing these games
I’ve broken your heart and caused so much pain
And all I’ve gotta say is

Girl, your body I can ignore
We'll be running with the night

Before she was born at all
(Ooh)
(Let me love you - Girl)
(Let me love you - Girl) Midnight, lock all the doors
Keep playing that song all day
Just the sound of the traffic
The patron of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering why I came
I said I'll try not to think of you
If you say you don't feel the same

Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

Feels like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Oooh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah, I should have shut my stupid mouth
The long table
The boomerang
Traveling way down south
And it's ironic 'cause it's probably the last time that you see me around

Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oh yeah
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me

Yeah, 'cause when I step outside, outside I'm bound to start a forest fire

I'm so hot that in cold weather
You're gonna wanna take off your sweater
No need for hats and gloves
Charlie Puth is gonna warm you up with his love
(Or maybe not)
What the hell's a fireplace?
(Who knows?)
If you're chilly you will really want me in your face
(Hello there!)
Fishes were cold-blooded at one time
But that all changed when I went for a dive

Halle Berry and the sun have got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty
Did I mention that I

In comparison to me, who is dripping with hot
Man, I can't help you with something that you're not
(Good God, you're ugly!)
Sunburned people and polar ice caps
They all hatin' on me
(They wack!)
But alligators, Jersey Shore Guidos, and photosynthesis
They all got my back, bitch

Emma Watson and the microwave ain't got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty, oh!

I am so hot, hot, hot You sing yourself to sleep at night
Melodies behind closed doors
I'm over by the corner
Listening to you from the second floor

I open up the curtains
To hear the thunder and the rain
We dropped off all the flowers
To wash away the pain

Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere
Wanna go with you anywhere

I'm sorry I kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you

But these tangerine dreams will not go away
I build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just give me company
Now I take everyday with a deep breath
'Cause I found out the hard way when he left
Suffering silently

These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again

These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again (Oh) I’m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I’m going for throttle
(Oh) Oh these instagram models
(Oh) I said, they're nothing but trouble

She’s leading me on the round
That’s perfect but closing down
I’m crying day you gone
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more
She’s so good at playing cards
But the minute she brings you joy
She’s showing you the door
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more

(Oh) I’m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems
(Oh) These instagram models
(Oh) Are nothing but trouble
(Oh) She going away now
(Oh) I’m going for throttle
(Oh) Oh, these instagram models
(Oh) I said, they're nothing but trouble

She’s situated on her roof
Now so tired of waiting her turn
And I ain't tryna go home
Can't take this no more
Ain't taking it no more
And I never believed it would actually happen
Your body's so tempting, my sweetest distraction
Lets get down on the floor
Can’t take this no more
Can’t take this no more

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

(Oh) I’m facing the bottle
(Oh) For all of my problems

Now I'm left with none
""I think you're beautiful""
Just doesn't work for you
You're back to square one
Thinking of somebody new

'Cause every line will come out wrong
I can't describe you in a song
You see the signs, that's me and you
We both colliding, and that's the truth

You don't even know and
You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh

How many times you gonna throw my shit up out your room
We'll stay inside get high and lounge the rest of the afternoon
You're so imperfect, and it's so worth it
We'll conversate for a few
'Cause in a few we gon' do what we came to do

'Cause every line will come out wrong
I can't describe you in a song
You see the signs, that's me and you
We both colliding, and that's the truth

You don't even know when
You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh
I'm talking about
Oh, oh, oh

So tell me you need me, hey
Tell me you need me
One, two three, whoah!

You'll never know what you do to me
And I, I don't know what you heard
But you deserve an overture

I feel like my heart is bleeding
Can't make up my mind
Time won’t stop
But now's not a good time
I know (...) 'till I give it one more (...)
Eh, I won’t needs me
But, now's not a good....
I've been thinking 'bout if you're worthy
I know you just say I'm playing the game
Tender time I'm hurting
Yeah I don't want to make something up
This toxic love, we’ve been going through
Like deja vu
But (...)
I feel like my heart is bleeding
Can’t make up my mind
I know
The deeps I've been trying and there's no denying
That girl you've got my heart falling so fast
My mind's racing, you've got me wasting
My days were endless till I see you pass

And I'm like
(Ooo-ooo)
Baby did I catch your eye?
(Ooo-ooo)
Can I see you tonight?

When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
(Come home with me)

Take my hand girl, we'll cross this land till
We find a place that we can all our home
Trust in me and I'll set you free
Babe I'm never ever leave you feeling cold

You got me like
(Ooo-ooo)
Tell me I'm the only one
(Ooo-ooo)
And I'll see you tonight

We'll have it all

One shot, one shot for my sorrows, oh yeah
Power up the white noise, maybe I'll forget her deep into the morning
And right inside this yellow house
I'm reading CDs on the couch
But it's better than being stranded
Nothing but myself, my studio apartment

We left this evening
Give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, off
When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all
We'll have it all

I don't think I'm sleeping tonight
Something 'bout my stomach doesn't feel right
What you left in my chest on the left side
Where your head-- nah, fuck it
Time to take a drive
Night skies got me feeling like Bruce Wayne
'Cept all I got is a pocket of loose change
Head and heart got me thinking that I'm too strange
Well maybe I'm different
Word to two chains, two lanes
Drift grip the wood crane
Lookin' at the exit signs, but it's your name (damn)
On some purple rain shit, feelin' like Prince
Gotta go and change my name chiz, same shit, ain't it?
Yeah, I know I don't seem complacent
Got enough on my chest but my heart's still vacant
And I can't take it
My love is unreciprocated
I've been through enough without ever gettin' the payment
But it's harder to heal than it is to endure
There's only so much that the liquor can cure
And all that liquor that's poured gave you a head of a tornado
Of every memory that had you trippin' before
All that Christian Dior denim, Louis Vuitton leather
Led 'em a late night, safe flight and good weather
Ain't enough to make me feel better
Ain't enough to make me forget all those nights in early December

I think I was dreamin'
But now I know I ain't been sleepin'
And some of these days, these feelings stoppin' me from eating
The pit of my stomach is heavy
I guess that's how it feels when you start to forget me
I apologize for not caring for myself
I've never known anything else than putting myself after everyone else
And that fucks me up, it's true
These late nights really are new
And there's so little I can do besides drive
Lay awake think about where you lay in the night
And fantasize about us living life in paradise
In a warm place where we never really have to die
But life ain't kind, we can't live fantasy
I just need to hear that you're maintaining sanity
Cuz it's more important to me that you're doing alright
Than the fact that I'm not sleepin' tonight What am I supposed to say?
I wanna look you in the eyes and tell you it's okay
But I can't, it hurts to know
At the end of the day, all I can do is hope
Hope to my core
'Cause I don't know anymore
Thought that heroes don't fall out the sky

That was before you got sick
Before you found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now

Every night, every day
You were fighting but you never showed it on your face
I don't know, what I would do
Baby, I would be so lost if I ever lost you
Oh, in my dreams
There I used to see
From a distance, I'd watch you fly

That was before you got sick
Before you found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now

I wanna hold all of your tears
And use them all to wash away the hurt
I wanna save you from your fears
Just to get you back the way you were

Before you got sick
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right now
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right now Where you think to go now, sexy lady?
You make it so damn hard to leave
Love the way you've been doing it lately, ooh
Love the way you back it up on me
Ey

Your body's craving the attention, no disrespect to you
I really wanna ditch, let's get together
So we can take a little rendezvous

Eh
She said
You know where to find me hey
You know where to find me work work
You know where to find me
Wanna see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's

Tryna do a little less conversation
Tryna cut right to the chase
Oh
This big beat bumping 808 drum
Tonight we're goin all the way
Oh

Your body's craving the attention, no disrespect to you
Ohhh
I really wanna ditch let's get together, hey
So we can take a little rendezvous

Eh
She said
You know where to find me hey
You know where to find me work work
You know where to find me
Wanna see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's


Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
You know where to find me... Yeah
Somebody give me, uh
Somebody give me the answer
You and me isn't the answer
You and me isn't
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be, if I knew how you felt about me?

It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
Part of me that cared inside it's gone
And I know, that I can't, get caught up

We could've been
And we tried to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've, damn Ooh

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, ""Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately

(Encore)
(Encore)
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (gotta come tell me now)
Ooo-oh (yeah)

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

She said ""Boy, tell me honestly""
""Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies""
""Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

(Encore)
(Encore)
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Ooo-oh (how long has it been goin' on baby?)
Ooo-oh (gotta come tell me now)
Ooo-oh (yeah)

You' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooo-oh (how long has it been goin' on?)
Baby When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold

And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend
At least we didn't intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
I won't give up...

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up Woah-oah, hm-hmm

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you

You just want attention
Tention (x14)
You just want a--


You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

You just want attention
Tention (x14)
You just want a--


You just want attention There's a moment when you find out who your true friends are
The ones who don't go by everyone else's ways
And it's important to realize who your one and true love is
And to not look back on yesterdays

Don't be askin' what this world needs now
You need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
'Cause you do you better than anyone here
So mark this as your year

Tomorrow I'm going on that train and I'm gonna pretend that it doesn't stop
'Cause I'm taking all my fears and making them my destination
Bottom all the way to the top

Don't be askin' what this world needs now
I need to see what makes me come alive somehow
'Cause I do me better than anyone here
So mark this as my year

Don't be askin' what this world needs now
I need to ask what makes you come alive somehow
'Cause I do me better than anyone here
This is my year
I have no fear, 'cause all my obstacles are clear Yo

Kids will call me lame
Cause I'm failing tests

You don't know what prep school is like
Just like I never won a fight
Just because you know me
Doesn't mean that you're my homie
Thinking you can get above me
But I fucked you right and sorry
Just in case you have yet to hear
I am the rapper that you fear
I don't know cause I'm not broke
Put some clothes and money first

And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Why'd you have to leave so soon
Why'd you have to go
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most
""Cause I don't really know how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

How do I breathe without you
I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waiting right here for you
Till the day you're home

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again
See you again
When I see you again It's 10 p.m. and I am missin'
My seventh song for December 2nd
My mind's gone blank
I cannot think clear
About the lyrics
For this damn song here

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this?
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits

It's 12 A.M. and I am so screwed
Looking up at people falling on YouTube
Getting so bored to the highest degree
This must be so easy for Kenny G

How do people have the attention span
To go and do this?
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits
Another sappy love song
My listeners will be pissed
I would seriously pay someone
Right now to go and help me with this

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics

I suck
At writing lyrics

How do people have enough
Motivation to go and do this?
Feels like a day in this chair
And I haven't written down shit
Feel like I'm running out of ideas
For all these pieces
And every time I try to get done
Procrastination increases

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics Lyrics available upon release. Stay tuned! Soon as I walk in the doorway a dress hit the floor
I know all the curves of your body
Yeah, I been there before
And now I take my time just to tease ya
So you know what's in store
Yeah, I'ma get you like that then go right back for more

'Cause I been missing you like you've been missing me
I'll keep you coming soon
You'll never wanna leave
(Hey)

I know just where to touch to get you feeling
Every inch of your love 'cause I know you by heart
I know just where to kiss to get you breathing
Baby, I don't know much but I know you by heart

I know you by heart

Nothing like sex on a Sunday
We got nowhere to go
We gon' be here 'til Monday
So we should take it slow
Tuesday to Thursday you call me
'Cause we on a roll
Yeah, I'ma kiss you like that then on Friday I'm back for more

'Cause I been missing you like you've been missing me
I'll keep you coming soon
You'll never wanna leave
(Hey)

I know just where to touch to get you feeling
Every inch of your love 'cause I know you by heart
I know just where to kiss to get you breathing
Baby, I don't know much but I know you by heart

Your body's second nature
I know what it takes to shake ya
I don't have to lift a finger
'Cause I know you by heart
I'll be the first to taste ya
The second that you wake up
You don't have to lift a finger
But I know you by heart

Know you by heart
Know you

'Cause I been missing you like you've been missing me
I'll keep you coming soon
You'll never wanna leave

I know just where to touch to get you feeling
Every inch of your love 'cause I know you by heart

'Cause I know you by heart
I'll be the first to taste ya
The second that you wake up
You don't have to lift a finger
But I know you by heart Oh, you can cry on my shoulder
Everything's alright
All the pain is finally over
You can close your eyes Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I get home from work, you get home from work
You on the phone though, can't put it down like it's a curse
It's the worst, all I want is time with you
But it's hard to find, a few minutes that align with you
I get inclined to decline that you're mine the truth
Is in the lines, I design in my mind - the booth
Is where I find - I can rhyme & release the flow
Of the pain obtained while being alone, don't wanna know

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I Don't know where you've been
But I know You've been lost
Covered in frost bite, I'm up all night
With a beer and a cross, sitting across
From an empty vessel
Sad shell of what used to be
& I'm confused as to who you really are anymore
How'd we lose what was you and me
All your fluidity turned to acidity
Visibly hindering ability
Like you wanna get rid of me
And I'm not really sure that you're into me, anymore
Which is injuring me even more
Why'd you lock your love up in a drawer
Cutting and stabbing my heart to the core
You just ignore, so

We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore (nah)
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do (nah)
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for? (tell me)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I miss you

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain They say the first line of the song is the hardest to come up with
But I just can’t help writing about you
And I know this may sound cheesy in a lot of different ways
I swear all of the things I say are true

She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I’ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

So give her your attention and it’ll turn into something
Good

Well, I was walking down MacArthur Park
Just to find someone
Who steal my heart
But it seems like the classmate  love your face
And if the way that you talk
And the way that you walk
Had a  between in something of mine
I’d sure give up the weller in a day

She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I’ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

So give her your attention and it’ll turn into something
Good

She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
She makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because

You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I’ll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could

To others, to others, to others
I’ll let your heart decide for you
And walkin’ and talkin’ with her like you should
So be good to her
And it’ll turn up to something very good Monday you hate to drive home
With a million red lights on the strip
That night, I come to your door
You’re the one I’ve so desperately missed

Do you remember always staying home with me
And watching friends
Well I’d do anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
Don’t leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you’ll feel the same way
Tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone
Ooh~

In my fantasy, I see you next to me
Every night, every day
This empty room feels so strange
Wanna stay, here with you
Go all the way, this afternoon
You caught me with nothing to say
(Caught me with nothing to say~)

Do you remember when I’d always
Lie with you til’ 3 a.m
Well I’d give anything for that again

Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
(With me up in Boston)
Don’t leave me here all alone
(Don’t leave me here all alone)
And I wonder if you’ll feel the same way tomorrow
(Same way tomorrow)
If you see me calling your phone
(You see me calling your phone)

Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Ooh, baby

So come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
(Me up in Boston)
Don’t leave me here all alone
(Don’t leave me here all alone)
And I wonder if you’ll feel
The same way tomorrow
(Same way tomorrow)
When you see me calling your phone
(You see me calling your phone)

When you’ll see me calling your phone
Your phone
When you see me calling your phone I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
""Don't forget me,"" I beg
""I'll remember,"" you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
(Ohh)
And I reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
(Ohh)

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
(I need you now)
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
(I need you now)
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
(Looking at you)

Another shot of whisky
Can't stop looking at the door
And I was wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
(Ohh)

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
(Looking at you)
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
(I need you now)
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
(I need you now)
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
(Oh Ohh...)  (Yeahh...)
Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
(need you now)
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh, baby I need you now
(Looking at you) (Looking at you)   (I can reach your mind...)

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up (call you up)
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Be at one (be at one), oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, ooh
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
What are you doing, huh huh?
Doin', what are you doing, huh huh?
You just want attention
You just want attention

You just want attention This goes out to the most beautiful girl that I saw just the other day
She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away
This goes out to the one and only Miss Mysterious
The thought of being next to her has got me so delirious
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there?

'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way
Girl you got me love sick and
Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever feel the same?
Never been acquainted
I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name

Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
'Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
'Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true?
(Oooh)
Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?
(Oooh)
Just tell me if you're out there, if you're out there

'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way
Girl you got me love sick and

We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore I'll miss you singing Stevie Wonder
Isn't she lovely till three a.m
When you'd always look into my eyes
I never wanna say goodbye
Sitting and waiting for it to happen again

But for every time I saw you block my call
I wish I never been with you at all

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong
Oh oh
You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know
Oooh oooh
Two months never felt so long
Long, so long

I'll miss the trips to New York City
Listening to you from back stage
After all these hours pass me by
You just need some time with the guys, what about me?

Every time you say I waste your time
I wish you and I could go and press rewind

You got your sold-out shows, your perfect hair
But when it comes to me, baby, did you ever care?
I've never met nobody who talks about themselves so strong
So strong
Oh oh
You got your big red car, your fancy clothes
How I ever fell for you, I'll never really know

Gotta get some flowers
After I get some food
(Do-do-do-do-do, eating at McDonald's)
God, I really needed that
But I'm already late, oh, crap!
Have to come up with an excuse
After I get more food
(Mmm, now I'm eating at Wendy's)
I'm fifteen minutes late
She's really gonna hate me
I better call her now
Oh look, a bakery!
(Mmm, yummy, yummy cupcakes)
This really isn't good
I need to get her a gift
Oh, perfect, I can get her one right there!
(At the Home Depot, trying to get some wood)
Thirty minutes late
My chances aren't great
 if she wants
After I fight in this battle
(Fighting, fighting, in a battle, blowing people's heads off)
I'm putting my foot down right now!
(Need to look at these puppies before I go on my date)
Forty minutes late
(Ooh, lemonade)
No more pit stops
I gotta make it, oh

Putting the key in
(After I get some rest)
Gotta step on the gas

Total concentration

(More cupcakes)
Now I'm at her house!
Ooh, Charlie Puth, you dumbass
You showed up three hours late
She couldn't wait anymore

""Hey Charlie, wanna hang out?""
Yeah sure, I'll pick you up right now
Charlie the dumbass slept through his alarm
Then stalked his friends on Facebook
And then went to an office party
He doesn't even work in an office I heard you slam the door
And fall right to the floor
You kept on crying
That look upon your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like this
Makes me wanna die

We lie beneath the stars
Just two foolish hearts
Familiar faces
Now I lie here all alone
Sitting by the phone
There's too much space here
Oh baby, come back and stay with me

Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
It's never over to me

My heart
(My heart)
Is your's
(Is your's)
For yesterdays and for taking it
My heart
(My heart)
Is broken
You're all that I need

Just don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)
Don't forget about me
(Don't forget about me)
Don't forget about me
Oh me, Oh me
Cause letting you go hurt me

Cause this is not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause this is not over
To me, to me, to me
Never over you and me Bluebird, sweet bluebird
How you remind me of a girl
Who took from me my world
She stole every heartbeat
But I'd like to say I gave them first
To save me from this curse

Bluebird, sweet bluebird
Outside my window with nothing to say
But sing of better days
But those days ain't coming
Feel like just running away
Running away

Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking us apart
It's best stay we apart, best we stay apart

Bluebird, sweet bluebird
It seems like years since you've been here
Since the day you disappeared
Though my heart's still aching
I know you're safe where you are
Wherever you are

But you're not coming home with me tonight, oh no

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new (someone new)
Yeah, you just want attention (oh), I knew from the start (the start)
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you (over you), oh


What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? (What are you doin'?)
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh I took her out to dinner
I thought I'd had a winner
And what happened next came to a surprise to be
So I walked her to her front door
Waiting for what I had hoped for
But then she hugged and said goodnight to me
As I took my bad, stepped off that porch, I saw a friend of mine
She stepped closer then grabbed my hand and met me eye to eye

That's when she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!

So I took her down to the shoreline
The weather that day was so fine
And not to mention she looked pretty good too
And later at the movies, romantic comedy
I hate those films but for her I managed to get through
I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes
As I desperately tried to say something she put her finger on my lip and said one more thing

She kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!

It's nice to know that she cares enough about me
I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming
And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same
About that other girl's name

Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa! (Snippet)

Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to

I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore

I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know

Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide (oh)
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try

And that's okay

I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved

She said, ""Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Oh, oh, oh…
How long?
How long?

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Oh, oh, oh…
How long?
How long? Aw yeah
What?
I have a little story to tell you
And it goes like this

I was walking down the street, bitch, walking down the street
Walking down the street with shoes at my feet
But then I saw a glimpse from the corner of my eye
I saw this smokin' hot broad walk by
I said, ""Yo baby, what's up?"", She said ""you talkin' to me?""
""Well, duh, there's no one else on the street""
""You're coming back to my place"" This how it's gonna be
But then something hit my face

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna mack this bitch?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosher

The next day, nothing's new
Sitting on this seat like I always do
Saw them other bitches walkin' my way
""Man… I need a bagel""
Eating at the deli with my bagel and jelly
While I'm observing the trees
Gosh, how did they get so green and plump?
Wait, what just hit my face? Oh my—

Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosher I see the people all the time
Counting all their dimes
Walking around living one big lie
I bet they all go far
Driving those rented cars
Going around in circles hoping that you'll see them

You say you're quintessential
You say you're something special
But it's time to move on
And get on with your life

Everybody (everybody)
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
(oooh yeah it's not all about the wealth)

And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else

I hear them talking everyday
The purchases they made
Hiding their faces with those fake designer shades
(Yeah)
They say their doing well
But they should take a look at themselves
Theres gotta be something in their life they know thats missing

You say you're quintessential
You say you're something special
But it's time to move on
And get on with your life

Everybody (everybody)
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
(oooh yeah it's not all about the wealth)

And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else

(everybody)  (everybody)  (everybody)  (everybody)  (everybody)

Everybody
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
(It's not all about the wealth)
It's not all about the wealth

And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
(life up on the shelf)
Theres nothing else

Everybody
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
It's not all about the wealth

And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else Oh-oh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

Iʼm sitting here alone again
Waiting for you to come see me now
As time passes by
In the blink of an eye
I know Iʼll get to see you somehow
You are sitting home another night
Waiting for someone to hold you tight
Time passes by
So quick indeed
This time youʼre slipping away from me
Itʼs been a long, cold, hard winter
It was a long, drawn-out spring
You took no wrong when you saw nothing in me
But our love was something nice to see

We were sitting alone on the beach
Letting all the sand between our feet
As time passes by
Blink of an eye
Amazing how things ainʼt what they used to be
Ainʼt what they used to be...
It was the shortest summer
The fall was so abrupt
Thought youʼd be happy with the way things were
But I guess it wasnʼt enough

I am outside sitting, writing this song
You could have guessed that all along
Time passed me by
So quick indeed
And youʼre the only thing that Iʼm missing
I wrote this song all last night
Tried to make the lyrics fit just right
But Iʼm still having trouble with this very last part
But I know itʼll come from my heart
But I know itʼll come from my heart...

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

         Ooo
Girl I really trusted you
Tore my heart right into two
I was gonna marry you
Til I caught you with another dude
Fool me once, you fool me twice
All you did was tell me lies
Should've taken their advice
Now my heart is cold as ice Alright
Ooh, yeah

I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh

She said, ""Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh

I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah

She said ""Boy, tell me honestly""
""Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies""
""Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh (encore)
Oooh-ooh-oh
How long has this been goin' on, baby?
Ooo-oh (yeah)
Ooo-oh, you gotta go tell me now
Oooh-ooh-oh

She said, ""Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?"", yeah
She said, ""Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know""

How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me ""baby""
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

(Ooo-oh, yeah)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
You've been creepin' 'round on me
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
How long has it been goin' on, baby? Oh
(Ooo-oh)
How long has this been goin' on?
(Ooh, encore)
(You gotta go tell me now)
(Oooh-ooh-oh)
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby

         Conversation

Tired of this conversation
We didn't come all this way
To touch a little, kiss a little
All night long
You wanna hear me say it
I know I kept you waitin'
Just a little, just a little
All night long

If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
Not just a little, just a little

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official

Tired of this conversation
We didn't come all this way
To touch a little, kiss a little
All night long
You wanna hear me say it
I know I kept you waitin'
Just a little, just a little
All night long

Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than
If you want it, let me know

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official

Let me know
Would you ever
Would you ever

Let me know

Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official What you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
(No oh, oh baby, no)
You say you're leaving
Well, if you wanna leave there ain't nobody stopping you
(No oh, oh baby, no)
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
I never cheated
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable
(No oh, oh baby, no)
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
(No oh, oh baby, no)
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please (oh no, won't say please)
I won't fall to the ground on my knees (on my knees)
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, (baby, honestly), baby, honestly

For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
But tell me what you've done for me
(Tell me what you've done for me)
But tell me what you've done for me I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved He's such a nice boy, so well-mannered
He's so much better than the last one you brought around
Please and thank you, everything matters
I'm gonna make sure that she knows I'm the best she's found

The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things that we do

Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do

Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all of the things that we do

Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo (Back of the Benzo)
More than a friend zone (More than a friend zone)
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock

The moment she walks out that door (She walks out the door)
I'm not pretending anymore

If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things that we do

Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do

Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all of the things that we do There's a piano here by the way
I'm not just playin' in the air

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
You've been going 'round, going 'round, going 'round
Every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I
Be at, be at one, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd
Call you up
Baby, now that we're, now that we're, now that we're
Right here standin' face to face
You already know, 'ready know, 'ready know
That you won, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine, yeah
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start

You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
Sing it with me

You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Yeah, you just want attention, I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you

What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', love?
What are you doin' to me?
