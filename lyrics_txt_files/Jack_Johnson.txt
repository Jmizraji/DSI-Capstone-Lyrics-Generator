"Can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain’t no need to go outside

But baby you hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe
Laka ukulele
Mama made a baby
I really don’t mind the practice
'Cause you're my little lady
Lady, lady love me
'Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside

And we could pretend it all the time
And can't you see that it's just raining
There ain’t no need to go outside

Ain’t no need, ain’t no need
Mm-mmm-mm-mmm
Can't you see, can't you see
Rain all day and I don't mind

But the telephone singing, ringing, it's too early
Don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough
Just so easy when
The whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm
Wake up slow
Mh-mmm
Wake up slow

But baby
You hardly even notice
When I try to show you this
Song it's meant to keep you
From doing what you're supposed to
Waking up too early
Maybe we could sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we could pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day and I really really really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see
We've got to wake up slow There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too
Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
This world keeps spinning

And there's no time to waste
Will it all keep spinning, spinning round and round and
Upside down
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found?
I don't want this feeling to go away

Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Please don't go away
Is this how it's supposed to be?
Is this how it's supposed to be? I know she said it's alright
But you can make it up next time
I know she knows it's not right
There ain't no use in lying
Maybe she thinks I know something
Maybe maybe she thinks it's fine
Maybe she knows something I don't
I'm so, I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down

I know she loves the sunrise
No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes
And I know that when she said she's going to try
Well it might not work because of other ties and
I know she usually has some other ties
And I wouldn't want to break them, no, I wouldn't want to break them
Maybe she'll help me to untie this but
Until then, well, I'm going to have to lie too

It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go
And often times we're lazy
It seems to stand in my way
Because no one, no, not one
Likes to be let down
It seems to me that maybe
It pretty much always means no
So don't tell me you might just let it go

The harder that you try baby, the further you'll fall
Even with all the money in the whole wide world
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me
Please please please don't pass me by
Everything you know about me now baby, you're going to have to change
You're going to have to call it by a brand new name
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag me down
And just like a tree down by the water baby I shall not move
Even after all the silly things you do
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag
Please please please don't drag me down Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs
But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't  the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Ah maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long
But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
Fool, hm hm Well, I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard he likes to race
I heard that six or seven words he likes to use
Are always in bad taste
And I heard that Monday's just a word we say
Every seven times around
And then we pin the tail on Tuesday
Watch those strings go up and down
The elephant in the room begins to dance
The cameras zoom into
His mouth begins to move
Those hateful words he uses

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

And all the real estate in my mind is for sale
It's all been subdivided
Divided into reasons why
My two opposing thoughts at once are fine
The residue from the price tag
On the tip of my tongue
The words don't come they go
How many likes I gotta get
Before I know the truth
And the truth is
Season three will be a great reason
To forget all about reality's
A slippery slope
Watch the TV scream and shout it

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite at all

Now I heard the blinker's on
I heard we're changing lanes
I heard we need more space
I heard that six or seven words are in bad taste
It's absurd to believe that we might
Deserve anything
As if its balanced in the end
And the good guys always win

I don't care for your paranoid
Us against them fearful kind of walls
I don't care for your careless
Me first gimme gimme appetite
With the residue from the price tag
On those two opposing thoughts in my mind
Us against them fearful kind of walls Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was some time in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind
So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon
Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's Rewind
Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are
We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at
Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember? I know I've seen your face somewhere
Selling something, some big idea
I know I've seen that vacant stare
Selling sunsets for somebody else

You find yourself asking yourself
What is any of it worth
You find yourself looking up at night
From the bottom of the earth

And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore?
And oh, did your sheep start jumping?
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?

The taste of trouble on your lips
'Cause now they're biting at your thoughts
You tell yourself just to turn away
But you know you've already lost

The smell of rain when it’s on a wind
Will never be paid in full
You try in vain to account for this mess
And everything that you stole

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth
Did they need a little something more than this?

'Cause now they're biting at your feet
They got you running from this place
Now they're breathing down your neck
Your eyes look lonely in your face

I see you looking just out of frame
What is it pulling you there?
'Cause things can never stay the same
So what is keeping you here?

Ooo
And oh, can this world not afford to sleep anymore? (Ooo)
And oh, did your sheep start jumping? (Ooo)
They grow out their teeth
They need a little something now
Every time you think, well, they’d be biting at your thoughts
And every time you blink, well, you'll be so damn far
But you want more than this
I know I've seen your face somewhere I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make me want to sing
She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home
She could make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You've got to be careful when you've got good love
Because the angels will just keep on multiplying
But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine

We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh oh oh ohh!
Mmmmm.. I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
There's food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
Into my attic, whistling static when the young learn to fly
I will patch all the holes up again
Well, I can't believe that my lime tree is dead
I thought it was sleeping, I guess it got fed up with not being fed
And I would be too, I keep food in my belly
And hope that my time isn't soon, isn't soon
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
In the back of our house there's a trail that won't end
We went walking so far that it grew back again
And there's no trail at all only grass growing taller
Get out my machete battle with time once again
But I'm bound to lose because I'll be down if time don't win
I've got to get home there's a garden to tend
All the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
Own family trees teach them, thank you and please
They spread their own roots, then watch their young fruit grow again
And this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins
And so I tried to understand what I can't hold in my hand
And whatever I find, I'll find my way back to you
And if you could try to find it too
Because this place is overgrown, it's a waxing moon
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
I said, Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too
Home is wherever we are, if there's love here too I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walking as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now so for now I
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
Well this engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get
To where I don't need to be so I
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I want to break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down
But you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
You don't know nothing but you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
You keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright, so put the blinds down low
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I want to break on down
But I can't stop now It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could

I remember when you and me, mmm, how we used to be just good friends
Wouldn't give me none
But all I wanted was some
She's got a whole lot of reasons
She can't think of a single one
That can justify leaving
And he got none but he thinks he got so many problems
Man he got too much time to waste
His dreams are like commercials
But her dreams are picture perfect and
Our dreams are so related though they're often underestimated

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

Well I was eating lunch at the D. L. G
When this little girl came and she sat next to me
I've never seen nobody move the way she did
Well she did and she does and she'll do it again
When you move like a jellyfish
Rhythm doesn't mean nothing
You go with the flow
You don't stop
Move like a jellyfish
Rhythm is nothing
You go with the flow
You don't stop

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could

If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me
If you would only listen
You might just realize what you're missing
You're missing me

It's as simple as something that nobody knows
That her eyes are as big as her bubbly toes
On the feet of a queen of the hearts of the cards
And her feet are all covered with tar balls and scars
It's as common as something that nobody knows
That her beauty will follow wherever she goes
Up the hill in the back of her house
Would she love me forever
I know she could Oh you win, it's your show now
So what's it going to be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch oh ?
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad, getting worse so...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused, got too much to lose
Give me some truth now, whose side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob-tube
I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your whole reason
You let's beginning the show
And all I really want to know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

(Where'd all the good people go?)
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on today, anyway
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Okay, whatever you say
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone I heard this old story before
Where the people keep on killing for their metaphors
But don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it just isn't so easy like that
So I turn the page
And read the story again
And again and again
It sure seems the same
With a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing, always guessing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments,
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading?
We'll never know
It all happened so much
Faster than you can say disaster
Want to take a time-lapse
And look at it backwards find the last word
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're afterBut after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot just
One breath in a chain of thought
We're moments just combusting
We feel certain but we'll never never know
It sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping
Rebuilding never growing
Never know
If you never know
Never know
Never know
Knock knock, coming door to door
To tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
And things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoon-feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again
It sure seems the same
So many different names
Our hearts are strong, our heads are weak
We'll always be competing never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing, confusing
But the true things
All we got is questions
We'll never know
Never know
Never know
Never know... They say Taylor was a good girl
Never one to be late
Complain express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift
Passing out the tickets
You're going to have to pay her
If you want to park here
Well mommy's little dancer has
Quite a little secret
Working on the streets now
Never going to keep it
It's quite an imposition
And now she's only wishing
That she would have listened
To the words they said
Poor Taylor

Well she just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And she'll pretend that
She's somewhere else
So far and clear
About 2,000 miles from here

Well Peter Patrick pitter patters on the window
And Sunny Silhouette won't let him in
And poor old Pete's got nothing because he's been falling
But somehow Sunny knows just where he's been
He thinks that singing on a Sunday's going to save his soul
But now that Saturday's gone
Well sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
But I can see, that his brake lights are on

And he just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And he'll pretend that
Well he's somewhere else
So far and clear
About 2,000 miles from here

She's such a tough enchilada
Filled up with nada
Giving what you going to give to get a dollar bill
She used to be a limber chick
Time's been ticking
Now she's finger licking to the man
With the money in his pocket
Flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world

If Taylor finds a better world
Then Taylor's going to run away Oi lienda
Bella che fa?
Bonita, bonita que tal?
But belle
Je ne comprend pas français
So you'll have to speak to me
Some other way When you were a little girl
And you were an ocean away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already listening to The Pixies

We were a little shy
When you were still an arm's length away from me
Didn't know what I wanted yet
But you were already reading beat poetry

We were a little free
When we were seven seas away from anything
Finally knew what I wanted then
But you were already my best friend
You had already become my best friend

When you were teaching geometry
We were both living off of your salary
I want to thank you for not kicking me out
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house
I wanna thank you for letting me live in our house

Finally we made a family
Make a little home then fill it up with children
Never mind the rest it's all just
Irrelevant if we're just stardust
This dusty old world won't rest and
These dusty little kids keep stretching high
Just like the tide

When you were a little middle-aged like me
And we were already 15 love songs deep
You give me too much love, so I blame you
Well, here's another love song for you
You give me too much love, what can I do?
Well, here's another love song for you
Just another love song for you When your mind is a mess so is mine I can't sleep
Because it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make the chances we take
They're not yours they're not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short, can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes
Woman, please get some sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way
Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving
It's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we would find, our minds would be free
To go to sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we told each other there is no other way Trouble travels fast
When you're specially designed for crash testing
Or wearing wool sunglasses in the afternoon
Come on and tell us what you're trying to prove
Because it's a battle when you dabble in war
You store it up, unleash it, then you piece it together
Whether the storm drain running rampant just stamp it
And send it to somebody who's pretending to care
Just cash in your blanks for little toy Tanks
Learn how to use them
Then abuse them and choose them over conversations
Relationships are overrated
""I hated everyone"" said the sun
And so I will cook all your books
You're too good looking and mistaken
You could watch it instead
From the comfort of your burning beds
Or you can sleep through the static

Who needs sleep when we've got love?
Who needs keys when we've got clubs?
Who needs please when we've got guns?
Who needs peace when we've gone above
But beyond where we should have gone?
We went beyond where we should have gone

Stuck between channels my thoughts all quit
I thought about them too much, allowed them to touch
The feelings that rained down on the plains all dried and cracked
Waiting for things that never came
Shock and awful thing to make somebody think
That they have to choose pushing for peace supporting the troops
And either you're weak or you'll use brute force-feed the truth
The truth is we say not as we do
We say anytime, anywhere, just show your teeth and strike the fear
Of god wears camouflage, cries at night and drives a dodge
Pick up the beat and stop hogging the feast
That's no way to treat an enemy
Well, mighty, mighty appetite
We just eat them up and keep on driving
Freedom can be freezing take a picture from the pretty side
Mind your manners wave your banners
What a wonderful world that this angle can see Back when all my little goals seemed so important
Every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion
But soon

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

We went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
Maybe if we save them we could build a little home
But then the hailstorm came, it yelled
“You need to let go, you got no control""
No

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you

This weight’s too much alone
Some days I can’t hold it at all
You take it on for me
When tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you
Yea when tomorrow’s too much I’ll carry it all
I got you

I got you
I got everything, I’ve got you
I don’t need nothing more than you
I got everything, I’ve got you It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look
He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Well I guess you could say
That he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
Digging deep into the ditch, every chance he missed
And the mess he made
'Cause hate is such a strong word
And every brick he laid, a mistake they say
That his walls are getting taller, and his world is getting smaller
Better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look
He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
If the weather gets better we should get together
Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'd be twice as clever
So staple it together and call it bad weather
Mh mh After all this time
After all of these seasons
After your own decision to go to the water for a reason
It's only the ocean and you
And all of these lines
Will all be erased soon
They go out with the tide
And come back with the waves so
It's only the ocean and you

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in

When this work is done
And this coat is dry
When this world's too much
It will be
Only the ocean and me
When these sails go up
Mountains fade away
Stars come out
I'm finally free
It's only the ocean and me

You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll over me
And you pull me in
And you pull me in
You don't want
You don't wait
You don't love oh, but you don't hate
You just roll right over me
And you pull me in
And you pull me in

You just roll over me
And you pull me in Look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm just like those
And what about your soul? Is it cold?
Is it straight from the mold, and ready to be sold?
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling, because those are only removable things
And what about your mind? Does it shine?
Are there things that concern you, more than your time?

Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, when they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone

Look at you, out to make a deal
You try to be appealing, but you lose your peel
And what about those shoes you’re in today?
They’ll do no good, on the bridges you burnt along the way
Are you willing to sell anything?
Gone, with your herd
Leave your footprints
And we’ll shame them with our words
Gone, people, all careless and consumed, gone

Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, if they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone A brand new baby was born yesterday, just in time
Papa cried, baby cried, said your tears are like mine
I heard some words from a friend on the phone
Didn't sound so good
The doctors gave him two weeks to live
I'd give him more if I could
You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could
Down the middle drops one more grain of sand
They say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind they help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you've got to go we'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out, one comes in
You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We can rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we've found
Safely walk to school without a sound
We safely walk to school without a sound
Well, here we are no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books and show and tell
Play time, we will throw the ball
Then back to school class the hall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
The teacher marks our height against the wall
And we don't notice any time pass
Because we don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
The teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes it when you sing
Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
While silly thoughts run through my head
Of the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow I'll bet
You and I will walk together again

'Cause I can tell that we are going to be friends
Yes, I can tell that we are going to be friends In my rear view
I watch you watching the twilight
Behind the telephone lines
Nothing to prove, or to assume
Just thinking that your thoughts are different than mine
In my rear view
I watch you
I give you your life, would you give me mine?
I see you slowly swim away
Because the light is leaving town
To a place that I can't be
There's no apologies

Just go on
Just go on
There are still so many things
I want to to say to you

But go on
Just go on
We're bound by blood that's moving
The moment that we start
The moment that we start

I see perfect little eyes
Watch the shadows of the clouds
And the surface of the ocean out the window of a plane
I get nervous when I fly
I'm used to walking with my feet
Turbulence is like a sigh that I can't help but over think
What is the purpose of my life
If it doesn't ever do
With learning to let it go
Live vicariously through you
You can do the same
It's the least you can do
Because it's a lonely little chain
If you don't add to it Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame everyone
You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard
Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How are you going to scratch any backs?
Better hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope the tide will take our lines and
Hope the tide will take our lines away
Take all our lines away The light was leaving in the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations
The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down
Nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough, all else fades
Fades away
It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise
Not so far behind
To give us just enough light
To lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations
Of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations All at once
The world can overwhelm me
There's almost nothing that you could tell me
That could ease my mind
Which way will you run
When it's always all around you
And the feeling lost and found you again
A feeling that we have no control
Around the sun
Some say
There's going to be the new hell
Some say
It's still too early to tell
Some say
It really is no myth at all
Keep asking ourselves are we really
Strong enough
There's so many things that we got
Too proud of
We're too proud of
We're too proud of
I want to take the pre-conceived
Out from underneath your feet
We could shake it off
Instead we'll plant some seeds
We'll watch them as they grow
And with each new beat
From your heart the roots grow deeper
The branches will they reach for what
Nobody really knows
But underneath it all
There's this heart all alone

What about when it's gone
And it really won't be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart is no place to be singing from at all

There's a world we've never seen
There's still hope between the dreams
The weight of it all
Could blow away with a breeze
If you're waiting on the wind
Don't forget to breathe
Cause as the darkness gets deeper
We'll be sinking as we reach for love
At least something we could hold
But I'll reach to you from where time just can't go You know I love my Lady, been together so long
Like a worn-out recording, of my favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personal columns, there was this letter that read:
""If you like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half-a-brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
Then I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape.""
-Instrumental-
I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady
Had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, Took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half-bad
""Yes, I like Piña Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, but I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow
And cut through all this red tape
At a bar called Scrappy Malloy's, we'll plan our escape.""
-Instrumental-
So I waited with high hopes, then she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady, and she said, ""Oh, it's you.""
And we laughed for a moment, and I said, ""I never knew,""
""I never knew you liked Piña Coladas, or getting caught in the rain and the feel of the ocean, and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
You're the lady that I've looked for, come with me and escape""
-Instrumental- Your shadow walks faster than you
You don't really know what to do
Do you think that you're not alone?
You really think that you are immune to it
It's going to get that the best of you
It's going to lift you up and let you down
Mmm-mmm-mmm

It will defeat you then teach you to get back up
After it takes away all that
You learn to love

Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't always have to hold your head
Higher than your heart

You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better hope you're not alone
You better be hoping you're not so
Hope you're not alone

Your echo comes back out of tune
Now you can quite get used to it
Reverb is just a room
The problem is that there's no truth to it
It's fading way too soon
The shadow is on the move
And maybe you should be moving too

Before it takes away all that you learned to love
It will defeat you and then teach you to get back up Understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it

Mom forget to tuck you in
Make you begin a war within your head
One that you could never win
Send in the troops and insecurities
What doesn't matter in the end
So daddy told you hold your chin up son

Understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, na, you can't control it


With the procession underway
Understand the magnitude of the melodies that they make
Did it fill your lungs with rage?
What's the matter, did catastrophe get your tongue tied in the fray?
When the band began to play
Daddy wiped the tears away, he said son

Please understand one thing
If and when you drink from this vast ocean
You can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it
Na, na, you can't control it Well, how many subplots you got runnin' around your mind?
The gordian knot must be cut through
Well, give me a red pen
I will simplify your story
Which part of yourself can you afford to lose?
If you show me your list, then I will show you mine
Let's kill off a character or two
All the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Is gonna rise and shine
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
It don't shine for you
Like the joy and the tear in your eye
Like the little star that could
Could you remember every mistake that you made?
At least all the ones you should? (Have made)
If you make it your wish, then I will make it mine
Try to make sense of who is who
All the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Is gonna rise and shine
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
Still gonna shine on this world
Past it too
It won't stop
It don't shi-ine just for you
Birds don't sing
Trees don't lose
Leaves don't change
Fa-all just for you
Shi-ine just for you
Shi-ine just for you
Shi-ine just for you
And how many subplots you got swimmin' through that mind?
Scream for sympathy or sing the blues
Run from the shadows or relax in the shade
Which road you gonna choose?
We've all got places to be; we've all got things to do
We've all got this moment it's ours to lose
And all the light under the sun
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
(Summer don't turn to fall)
And all the light under the sun
(It's not just for you)
And all the light above it, too
Still gonna shine Hey, little girl
You might not know this song
This is not the kind of song that you can sing along to but
Hey, little girl
Maybe someday
At least that's what all the good people will say

Hey, little girl
Look what you've done
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own

Hey, little girl
Black and white and right and wrong
Only live inside a song, I will sing to you
You don't ever have to feel lonely
You will never lose any tears
You don't have to feel any sadness
When you look back on the years
How can I look you in the eyes
And tell you such big lies?
The best I can do is try to show you
How to love with no fear

My little girl
You've gone and stole my heart and made it your own
You stole my heart and made it your own If I had eyes in the back of my head
I would have told you that
You looked good
As I walked away
If you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
You would've never been hungry
But you never really be
The more of this or less of this or is there any difference
Or are we just holding onto the things we don't have anymore

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out


Lot of people spend their time just floating
We were victims together but lonely
You got hungry eyes that just can't look forward
Can't give them enough but we just can't start over
Building with bent nails we're
Falling but holding, I don't want to take up anymore of your time
Time, time, time

Sometimes time doesn't heal
No, not at all
Just stand still
While we fall
In or out of love again I doubt I'm going to win you back
When you got eyes like that
It won't let me in
Always looking out

Always looking
Always looking
Always looking
Always looking out It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now
By now we should know how to communicate
Instead of coming to blows, We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all
Burning under the same sun?
Buy now and save, it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes its still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all
Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we're gonna blame now in all?
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame
By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?
It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?
Of sight, out of mind
And who we're gonna blame all in all?
It's just a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawing waves on the pavement
Shadows of the planes on the pavement

Its enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe its a dream and if I scream
It will burst at the seams
Whole place will fall to pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be digging
Instead they're looking up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens
The shadows on the way to the heavens

Its enough to make me cry
That don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found
We can learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen
They're talking about their plans on the paper
Building up from the pavement
The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement

Its enough to make me sigh
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The words are all around
But the words are only sounds
And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well
Lost in the well With everything ahead of us
We left everything behind
But nothing that we needed
At least not at this time
And now the feeling that I'm feeling
Well it's feeling like my life is finally mine
With nothing to go back to we just continue to drive

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

I didn't know what I was looking for
So I didn't know what I'd find
I didn't know what I was missing
I guess you've been just a little too kind
And if I find just what I need
I'll put a little peace in my mind
Maybe you've been looking too
Or maybe you don't even need to try

Without you I was broken
And I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side

With everything in the past
Fading faster and faster until it was gone
Found out I was losing so much more than I knew all along
Because everything I've been working for
Was only worth nickels and dimes

But if I had a minute for every hour that I've wasted
I'd be rich in time, I'd be doing fine

Cause without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side
So without you I was broken
But I'd rather be broke down with you by my side So much love
The kids are laughing in their sleep
Swimming through their dreams into the morning
So peaceful all the stories that we're told
Lead them through the night back from the shadows
So much joy every little girl and boy
Even better when they wake up tomorrow
So much love
In their little mistletee
Going to miss you until we meet again in the morning
So much peace in their pitter-patter feet
Any open eyes can see that minds are reaching
So much joy
I'm afraid to be swept away
Upstream there's a spring that brings in the new day
These are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need
And your crazy curly morning hair
Your maka piapia stare
Smiling down from the top of the stairs
You're so sweet
And your robot pictures spread around
I swear your feet don't touch the ground
Once it starts it don't slow down
But I don't want it to

And these are the gifts we keep
And this is the morning that we breathe
And then we see
These moments are the only gifts we need In the morning when the world came awake
Before you knew me I knew your name
It was painted across the day as it breaks
An impression in your window frame

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the garden
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

But one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me washing dishes
Singing from the bottom
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been in the ashes
Singing from the garden

Where everything reaches for the sun
Still unsure of what we'll become
But I need you to reach out to me
See in me more than I could see
Because I'm afraid that

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now
Right now

You see one day I'll be running this place
And one day I could take you away
But I want you to wonder what's my name
Because I need you to want me the same

When you saw me out your window
Singing from the garden
Only the beginning
I'm only getting started
I don't mind the digging
Baby, I'll work harder
I've been washing dishes
Singing from the bottom

One day is only two words we say
I don't want to let them get in the way
Of all the plans that we should be making right now
Right now

Who took the time and where did they take it?
I want to take it back
I don't want them to break it
All these plans that we should be making right now Brush-fire fairy-tales
Itsy-bitsy diamond wells
Big fat hurricanes
Yellow-bellied given names
Well shortcuts can slow you down
And in the end we're bound
To rebound off
Well dust off your thinking caps
Solar powered plastic plants
Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free

Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that

Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame-lines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax


Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen Behind the wheel against the road
Next to you is central coast
The central thought within my mind
Is how to stay within these lines, but still be free
Beneith the ground the giants sleep and maybe we're just in their dreams
The setting sun with every turn
Above the ground the oak trees burn
And they wheep, for rain
And for this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A pocket knife and no guitar
Coffee cup a deck of cards
To run dashboard feet
Flashlight children by the streem
A box of books
A book of rocks
One for the birds
One for the knots
That I will learn how to tie around this day
From sliding away
From this endless conversation
Instigated by the stars
A little word to keep it perdy
Facinated by it all
The first awake will stoke the coals
The early morning river roads
The last one in the swing will break
Stones will stake the kids will make those lines
Rocks and boxes by the creek
Words are broken smoke signals will leads us into the light
Into it all and
Always endless conversations
Implicated by the stars
A little wood to keep it burning
Facinated by it all I lived awhile without you
Darn near half my life
I no longer see our unborn children
Born to you my unwed wife
But yesterday I had a vision
Beneath the tree where we once talked
Of an old couple burning
Their love letters so their children
Won't be shocked

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away
All my friends are gettin older
So I guess I must be too
Without their loving kindness
I don't know what I'd do
Oh the wine bottle's half empty-
The money's all spent
And we're a cross between our parents
And hippies in a tent

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away
In a mucked up lovely river
I cast my little fly
I look at that river and smell it
And it makes me wanna cry
Oh to clean our dirty planet
Now there's a noble wish
And I'm puttin my shoulder to the wheel
Cause I wanna catch some fish

Love calls like the wild birds-
It's another day
A Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do...away Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Drop the anchor make it stop
Edible digital clocks
Infinity figure eight
Figure out what you're not
Junk-an a po, cut your loss
Come to cut your corners off
You're the rock and I'm the paper
You're the scissors I'm the rock

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Feel this storm go through my sail
Follow someone else's trail
Camera A, Camera B
In your home, on your TV
Hook me up, look in my eyes
Dilate do I surprise you?
Watch me blush, blink sink
Trust in me so you don't have to think

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field?
Kill the engine stop the car
Cut the lights and there you are
Stars so small
You're the king of them all
Stand tall, rack focus
Now you crawl back broken
Now the stars so vast
Heat wind storm break my mast

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got

Feel this storm go through my sail
Follow someone else's trail
Can you even feel what's real?
With such a shallow depth of field
Shot reverse shot

Drop the anchor make it stop
Make the moment, kill the clocks
Infinity figure eight
Figure out what you're not
Junk-an a po, cut your loss
Come to cut your corners off
You're the rock and I'm the paper
You're the scissors I'm the rock

Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got
Shot reverse shot
Look what the other got Fragments on the sea
Birds of prey above
All that lies beneath
No longer what it was, it changed
Why can't we relate
Shadows from the deep
Your thoughts were afraid of
Secrets that we keep
The surface of our love and hate
Why can't we relate
With ourselves with what we open
Up when it's too late
What we used to be
What we will become
Words we cannot see
Breaking up by one, by one
Slowly we felt under a spell
One by one
Slowly we wake up
Fragments of a scene
From a distance they jumped down
Little time machines
Messages of love and hate
Why can't we relate
With ourselves with what we open
Up when it's too late I want to be where the talk of the town
Is about last night when the sun went down
Yeah, and the trees all dance
And the warm wind blows in that same old sound

And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm hmm hmm

And the trouble I find is that the trouble finds me
It's a part of my mind, it begins with a dream
And a feeling I get when I look and I see
That this world is a puzzle, I'll find all of the pieces
And put it all together and then I'll rearrange it
I'll follow it forever
Always be as strange as it seems, hmm hmm
Nobody ever told me not to try, not to try
Oh, let's try, oh, let's try

And the water below gives a gift to the sky
And the clouds give back every time they cry
And make the grass grow green beneath my toes
And if the sun comes out I'll paint a picture all about

The colors I've been dreaming of
The hours just don't seem enough
To put it all together
Maybe it's as strange as it seems
Hmm hmm I sing oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  oooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh I come over early in the morning
I'm like a heat wave, without warning
And when I touch you my heart begins to flutter
'cause you're smooth and creamy like peanut butter
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I'm gonna flood you, like a love river
Awe baby the post man, is about to deliver
Cook you up some dinner, a little pasta
Listen to some music, a little Rasta
I said girl I wanna lay you down
I said girl I wanna lay you down
(Girl I wanna lay you down)
Aww baby baby
Don't you know I need your love!
So turn out the lights, bring out the candles
Wrap your arms around my love handles
They say the passion may not always endure
But this feeling that I have for you is burning up my world
Girl I wanna lay you down oooohhh
I said girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
I said Girl I wanna lay you down
Girl I wanna lay you down Daybreaks, earthquakes, waves come without you
When I see you, in my dreams you
Never speak never do you need to
Understanding under your wing
Under the impression you gave me
Did I take it did it take me
Further in this continuation
Become patient because there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You showed me when you came
If the ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down
Night falls on all of our decisions
All our plans and all ambitions
And this darkness comes to define us
Comes to take us and remind us
Find our way from this side of thinking
Unafriaid and under your wing
Night falls on us either way
Because there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You showed me when you came
The ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down
Cause night falls on us, either way
Night falls on us, either way
Cause there are some
Some rules I cannot break
You told me when you came
The ghost is supposed to love
And why do I feel pain
Because nothing is for keeps
You just can't hold a cloud
The shape will always change
And one day come back down She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

She knows the world is just her stage
And so she'll never misbehave
She gives thanks for what they gave her
Man, they practically made her
Into a mmm

She's the one that stumbles when she talks about
The seven foreign films that she's checked out
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm

She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm

But she's the one that stumbles when she talks about
So maybe we shouldn't talk about
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm Situation number one
It's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late
Situation number two
It's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate
Situation number three
It's the one that no one sees
It's all too often dismissed as fate
Situation number four
The one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait
Ha ha ha Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing
With the clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, yeah
The Rodeo Clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women and
The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard
Yeah, yeah
The changes occurred
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd
Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying
With the rest of the clowns
Yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm
With the rest of the clowns

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music Bring on your hunters
Let them bring their dogs
It's me that you wanted
I've been right here all along
Right here all along
You better bring your buckets
We've got some dreams to drain
I'll be at the bottom
I've been right here waiting so long
Just waiting so long

Dreams to drain
Put them in a cage
Unlock the pain
And I'll be here waiting

You fell asleep with the key
All your walls
Mean nothing to me
I know you'll come back
To set us free

Run, my dear son
Until we get to the trees
And then keep on going all the way
We've got to get right down to the sea
We've got to get to the sea
Oh, my dear son
We've got to get to the sea

But don't you touch the water
Don't you barely breathe
And if you see yourself
Looking back at you
You're going to have to leave
You're going to have to leave
I don't want you to go
But you've got to leave I can't give you everything you want
But I could give you what you thought you need
A map to keep beneath your seat, you'll read to me in time I'll get you there
But fold it up so we don't find our way back soon, nobody knows we're here
We can park the van and walk to town
Find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find
And talk about the road behind how getting lost is not a waste of time
Le Bois d'Amour will take us home in the moment we will sing as the forest sleeps

Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

Well, I will make the table into a bed
The candle is burning down it's time to rest
I can't take back things already gone, but I could give you promises for keeps
And I would only take them back if they become your own and you give them to me

And, it's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well, it's all for the sake of arriving with you

We could make this into anything
We could make this into more than words we speak
This could make us into anything
It could make us grow and become what we'll be

How will we really know?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How can we really know?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How does it feel?
It's just like it feels
It's just like it feels
How does it feel?
It's just like it feels
How does it feel? I would turn on the TV but it's so embarrassing
To see all the other people I don't know what they mean
And it was magic at first when they spoke without sound
But now this world is going to hurt you better turn that thing down
Turn it around

""It wasn't me"", says the boy with the gun
""Sure I pulled the trigger but it needed to be done
Because life's been killing me ever since it begun
You can't blame me because I'm too young""

""You can't blame me sure the killer was my son
But I didn't teach him to pull the trigger of the gun
It's the killing on this TV screen
You can't blame me its those images he sees""

Well ""You can't blame me"", says the media man
Well ""I wasn't the one who came up with the plan
I just point my camera at what the people want to see
Man it's a two way mirror and you can't blame me""

""You can't blame me"", says the singer of the song
Or the maker of the movie which he based his life on
""It's only entertainment and as anyone can see
The smoke machines and makeup and you can't fool me""

It was you it was me it was every man
We've all got the blood on our hands
We only receive what we demand
And if we want hell then hell's what we'll have Imagine there's no heaven
Its easy if you try
And no hell, below us
And above us, is only sky

Imagine all the people
Livin for today
You-ou-ou
You may say, that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill
Or die for
No religion too

Imagine all the people
Livin the life for peace
You-ou-ou
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Imagine no posessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You-ou-ou
And you may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday, you'll join us
And the world will live as one Well, your mama made you pretty
And your mama made you sweet
Your daddy gave you daydreams
And more cushion in your seat
Your mama gave you those windows
To your beautiful soul
Your daddy got more love for you
Then you could ever know

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do
Ba doo Ba doo Ba doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh…

Well your mama made a promise
That your daddy's going to keep
Forever's how long
Your mama's going to love your
Daddy made you messy
And your mama made you neat
Forever's how long your daddy's going to love your
Mama made a clone
So she won't be alone
When the boys and me are getting
So out of control

You remind me of you
Yes you do now
You remind me of you
Yes you do
Ba doo Ba doo Ba doo
Whoo-ooh-ooh…

When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's going to dry your eyes
And your daddy's surely gonna try
But only mama's gonna dry your eyes
But your daddy's surely gonna try

When you cry when you cry
Well your mama's going to dry your eyes
And your daddy's surely gonna try
But only mama's gonna dry your eyes
But your daddy's surely gonna try There's a black hole pulling me in
I slowly bend until I see the back of my own sins
I stole my soul from myself now I wonder
Wonder, is there somebody with a perfect plan
That goes boom when it's stamped and we could understand
How the gods of old used to clap their hands to make thunder
So we're clapping and we're laughing like it was so absurd
In the future we'll be laughing at who we were right now
As man plays god with the land that he plunders
To the one unknown no one can know nor see
That's resistant to greed
If we listen to time after time, time can never go under

There's this vine trying to climb
Through the window into my life
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
There's this wine trying to find
Its way from the bottle into my mind
In my mind
In my mind
In my mind

And so this vine is trying to climb
Through the window into my life
To bring me symmetry
And memories of a back-lit breeze
Back into a dream on the ground
Looking up at the sun coming down
Into a world of boys and girls
Are holding handheld devices
While they're eating and they're sleeping
And they're dreaming of the prices
We'll be paying down the line
When the ice melts maybe it will turn to wine
And all the greatest of the heroes started jumping from the books
They started wearing ones and zeros
Looking more and more like crooks
They stole the sunlight from the future
Took a sip, drained half the glass, and put it back
And a lot of people like to have a feast
Not so many could stomach the killing
Lot of traffic on the streets, so who's really doing all the drilling
Keep on filling what can never be full
My imagination has got a hold on me Three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number

Because two times three is six
And three times six is eighteen
And the eighteenth letter in the alphabet is R
We've got three R's we're going to talk about today

We've got to learn to
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

If you're going to the market to buy some juice
You've got to bring your own bags and you learn to reduce your waste
And if your brother or your sister's got some cool clothes
You could try them on before you buy some more of those
Reuse, we've got to learn to reuse
And if the first two R's don't work out
And if you've got to make some trash
Don't throw it out
Recycle, we've got to learn to recycle

We've got to learn to
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number

3, 3, 3
3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36
33, 30, 27, 24, 21, 18, 15, 12, 9, 6, and
3, it's a magic number Don't worry
Everybody in the room notices you
Sit back and relax
The night is early
You're about to overdo it
So come and tell me something that you've already told me
Because everybody's heard all of your stories
I hope that some of them are true
I've been losing lots of keys lately
I don't know what that means
But maybe I'd be better off with things that can't be locked at all
I've been feeling kind of sea sick lately
See you reaching to me going to save me
You or me, I would much rather take the fall

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes the rain

Down comes our spirits again
But Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then

Been going up when now
For too long
Forget how
To let go
Seems too hard
Too late now
To turn around

The world has its ways
To quiet us down
The world has its ways
To quiet us down comes the rain

Down goes our spirits again
But Down comes the strength
To lift us up and then Is one moon enough
If I can see
With my cheap telescope?
Bet my neighbor has two or three
Down soon enough
What does it mean
If every time I look up
I see them
Laughing down on me?

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want's just out of reach

Is one moon enough
Well, it used to be
When I could see with my own naked eye
She was smiling down on me
Is one ever enough?
How could it ever be if my neighbor has more than me
And my moon
Just out of reach

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want is further from me
Hmm, hmm, hmm

Moon down soon enough
Now I can see a million moons that think of
Me and my moons
Always following me

Take that moon or break across the sea
Everything I want is just out of reach (hmm, hmm)
Why's that moon always following me? (hmm, hmm)
Everything I want's just out of reach (hmm, hmm)
Hmm, hmm, hmm I feel sorrow for the fear
And everything it brings
Wonder if it will ever sleep
I know you understand
Because you briefly look away
Focusing on nothing
So now everything is clear
Because there's no one to blame
You got no place to hide
It's only in your mind
And I saw you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You told me time never waits
What is that supposed to mean?

All of life
Is in one drop of the ocean
Waiting to go home
Just waiting to go home
And if the moon
Can turn the tides it can pull the tears
And take them from our eyes
And make them into monsoons

And turn them into mon-sooner or later
They'll weave their way back to the sea
Going to finally be free
Yeah, free for a while
Until they break
Like waves of sorrow
Always do, all into time
Because time never waits

Daddy don't day dream again
Just help me to believe and then
Show me that there's more than the meantime
Sonny, do you hear the sound?
You will feel it when it breaks
You will know it when its gone
How else can I explain?
Because it's only the pain
It's coming straight through
Come into a mind
Cross cut to you in amazement
Stumbling through the day
You tell me that time never waits
That's OK because I don't wait for time In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

And there's always been laugh and cry and birth and die
And boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
But then hurt at times

In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes

And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
Action,Reaction, sticks and stones and broken bones
Those for peace and those for war
And God bless these ones, not those ones
But these ones make

Times like these
And times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

But somehow I know it won't be the same
Yeah, somehow I know it'll never be the same I wanna wake up
And find my way out from in between these dreams
It's better when we're together baby
You look so pretty sleeping next to me
But you'll never never know
We feel so certain
But we don't know a thing
Cept for when I wake up in the morning
And im sitting in the shade
Eating banana pancakes we made
With all the good people
Really not so hard to find
Theres no other way
When my mind is a mess well
I think that its best that we wait
So im sitting waiting wishing
That you will believe in some kind of
Superstitions baby
Then you could see if we staple it together
And call it bad weather
Oh na na here I come
Oh now here I come Everyone laughed at her joke
As if they'd never even heard it before
And maybe they were truly amused
But every word that she spoke was a bore
And maybe it's because they had seen
The previews on the TV screen
Well this part is good and that's well understood
So you should laugh, if you know what I mean

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

Everyone knows what went down
Because the news was spread all over town
And fact is only what you believe
And fact and fiction work as a team
It's almost always fiction in the end
That content begins to bend
When context is never the same

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

I was reading a book
Or maybe it was a magazine
Suggestions on where to place faith
Suggestions on what to believe
But I read somewhere
That you've got to beware
You can't believe anything you read
But the good book is good
And that's well understood
So don't even question
If you know what I mean

But it's all relative
Even if you don't understand
Well it's all understood
Especially when you don't understand
Then it's all just because
Even if we don't understand
Then let's all just believe

But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
I believe
But there you go once again
You missed the point and then you point
Your fingers at me
And say that I said not to believe
I believe
I guess
I guess it's all relative It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

When I first saw you come across the room
And then you saw me, then I knew what to do
I tried to play it cool and attached no strings
But by the end oft he day, I needed the whole thing

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

You see I knew right then, that this could last so long
I went home that night, I wrote my first love song
And as the days went by, I knew I had it made
Well you could try to pretend, your smile gave it away

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

And now here we are, how could we ever know
I knew I loved you then and I've watched you grow
So it came to be, that I raised you and you raised me
Were lucky that way, because our love can never fade

No our love can never fade, yeah
Our love will never fade, yeah
Our love can never fade, yeah

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you
It feels good to be the one, that you want
When all I want is you

When all I want is you, can never fade
All I want is you, can never fade
When all I want is you Questions, I've got some questions
I want to know you
But what if I could ask you only one thing
Only this one time, what would you tell me?
Well, maybe you could give me a suggestion
So I could know you, what would you tell me?
Maybe you could tell me what to ask you
Because then I'd know you, what would you tell me?
Please tell me that there's time

To make this work for all intents and purposes
And what are your intentions, will you try, will you try?

Impressions, you've made impressions
They're going nowhere
They're just going to wait here if you let them
Please don't let them, I want to know you
And if they're going to haunt me
Please collect them, please just collect them
And now I'm begging
I'm begging you to ask me just one question
One simple question
Because then you'd know me, I'll tell you that there's time

To make this work for all intents and purposes
At least for my own

What is a heart worth if it's just left all alone?
If you leave it long enough and watch it turn into stone
Must we all always be untrue
Be untrue, be untrue, be untrue Yeah, and I'm just a waste of her energy
And she's just wasting my time, Mmhmmm
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste and we could waste it all tonight

And I don't pretend to know what you know
No, no
Now please don't pretend to know what's on my mind
If we already knew everything that everybody knows
We would have nothing to learn tonight
And we would have nothing to show tonight

Oh, but everybody thinks
That everybody knows
About everybody else
Nobody knows
Anything about themselves
Because they're all worried about everybody else
Yeah
Oh Maybe it's up with the stars
Maybe it's under the sea
Maybe it's not very far

Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

Maybe it's trapped in a jar
Something we've already seen
Maybe it's nowhere at all

Maybe this is how it's supposed to be
Maybe this is how it's supposed to be

Looking forward as we rewind
Looking back is a trap sometimes
Being here is so easy to do

If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to, if you want to
If you want to... And I'll wait here a while
Just long enough to be sure
That you didn't make a wrong turn
And I'll wait long enough
Maybe an hour or two
Before I decide it wasn't me, it was you
It wasn't me it was you
And I would like you to know
Although it seems sad to say
This was only the worst hour of my day
The worst hour of my day
How long has it been on your mind?
Do you think about it when we laugh?
I think that it's a big mistake
Because I think that we could make it last
Even if it's just for a while
I'll wait here for now
Just long enough to be sure
That you really want to go through with this

Because I don't really want to go through with this
Do you really want to go through with this? Hermit crabs and cowry shells
Crush beneath his feet as he comes towards you
He's waving at you
Lift him up to see what you can see
He begins his focusing
He's aiming at you
And now he has cutaways from memories
And close-ups of anything that
He has seen or even dreamed
And now he's finished focusing
He's imagining lightning
Striking sea sickness
Away from here

Look who's laughing now that you've wasted
How many years and you've barely even tasted
Anything remotely close to
Everything you've boasted about
Look who's crying now

Driftwood floats, after years of erosion
Incoming tide touches roots to expose them
Quicksand steals my shoe
Clouds bring the f-stop blues Sexy, sexy made up of plexi disasters
Pushing and pulling conservative rolling
Unlike plastic, easier to see through
Just like glass with no ring
Softer and sadder you sing
Sexy, sexy do your thing
Learn to be shy and then you can sting
Plexi, plexi bend don't shatter
Once you're broken, shape won't matter

You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
When its only in your mind

Quickly, quickly grow and then you'll know
It is such and awkward show to see
And everyone you wanted to know
And everyone you wanted to meet
Have all
Gone away
Well they've all
Gone away and

You're breaking your mind
By killing the time that kills you
But you can't blame the time
When its only in your mind

You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
You're breaking your mind
Mind, mind Well that's all right, if that's all right
Two thousand miles but still that's all right
And that's all right, if that's all right
I'll see you in the morning if that's all right
What would you do if I wrote you a song
Would you give me some loving when I get home?
Or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
Getting a hold of you? I try all the time

And I'll bet that, you don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes

What would you do if I sang you this song?
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
Because when my words kiss your ear, I'll be right there
The message is long because, baby, this is your song


And that's alright because
I'll be home when tomorrow morning When I woke, I was not awake
The light from the sun felt so far away
I went up, with all of my strength
Straight for the sun, from the depths I sprang
And I drank from the sea
But it opened up and swallowed me
So I sank down deep
Now I'm drunken like a seasick dream
In this dream, I am awake

I am awake

Well when did all of the waves
Roll right in and make me their slave
So I went so far away
I didn't look back, I'll come back someday
Mamma wept, and she weeped
She said horizon don't you take him from me
Black sails on the sea
Just carry me until I can be
Awake, in this dream

I am awake She's just waiting for the summertime when the weathers fine
She could hitch a ride out of town
And so far away from that low down good for nothing mistake making fool
With excuses like baby that was a long time ago
But that's just a euphemism if you want the truth he was out of control
But a short times a long time when your mind just won't let it go

Well, summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
Not from him because he followed her just to let her know
A dream's a dream
And all this living's so much harder than it seems
But girl don't let your dreams be dreams
You know this living's not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Your dreams your dreams be dreams Your voice is adrift
I can't expect it to sing to me
As if I was the only one

I'll follow you
The leaf that's following the sun
When will my weight be too much for you?
When will these ideas really be my own?
Because this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own pot
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong
When you're sad, I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one
Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known Drink the water drink it down
This time I know I'm bound
To spit it back up
I didn't want this
Salty substitute, just not going to do
I need some air, if I'm going to live through
This experience reminds me of a clock
That just won't tick
I want to wake up
From this concussion
But my dream is just not done
I'm late again
It's just one of those
Bad days look outside and
Be careful what you ride
You just might find

That you're out of time
To swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

He's got delusions between his ears
Man, it takes up too much space
And all that tension between his gears, man
He'll never ever leave this place
He's got stones instead of bones
And everybody knows
Uh man, that can make you real real slow
And if Heaven was below
He'd know just where to go
Dive in the ocean
And he'd sink like a stone
And he'd say

It's time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home

Hold on if you can
You're going to sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold
Hold on if you can
You're going to sink faster
Than you can imagine, so hold

It's just time to swim ashore
If I drift long enough
I'll be home The air was more than humid
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes
The bulls were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children were playing cricket with no shoes

The next morning we woke up, man, with a seven hour drive
Well there we were stuck in port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Mmhmm

Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving soundly engine running smooth
Officials were quite friendly
Once we drowned them with our sweet talk
And we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

The next morning we woke up with the sunrise to the right
Moving back north to Port Blaire
Where boats break and children stare
There were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven
Yes and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven From my tape deck there's a recklessness
Inflections of the world we want
All my friends, my rusty truck
We're just specks of love, directionless
Call this band just what we want
We can change the name from month to month
Four guitars and zero drums
We sounded folk but we wanted to be punk
In a world post punk
My friend had an old guitar
He took some lessons didn't get very far
An Ibanez with one knob stuck
Said, ""You can have that thing for fifty bucks""
Laura got a bass but it got no amp
Borrowed skills but never gave it back
Luke is just learning how to strum
But since he was the worst
We made him play the drums
Play the drums

You may find
In the palm
Of your hand
There's a flame
As it burns
As it climbs
As it turns
To a blaze
Well this flame
It won't last
Here it comes
Hold it close
Because this blaze
Can be fast
Set it free now, there it goes

Luke's mom said that after school
We could rehearse in the living room
But that sure didn't last too long
Guess she didn't know we'd play Fugazi songs
We played these songs in the talent show
And all of the girls would be in the front row
But in the end we just chickened out
Because we can't sing
We can only shout
Only shhh

You may find
In the palm
Of your hand
There's a flame
As it burns
As it climbs
As it turns
To a blaze
Well this flame
It won't last
Here it comes
Hold it close
Because this blaze
Can be fast
Set it free now, there it goes I got myself a new axe
For chopping all this wood that's
Going in that fire
It's gonna keep us warm tonight
Tonight, tonight

It's cold out that window
There's cards on this table
The kids are makin' magic and
The only thing that matters tonight
Is tonight, is tonight

And all our loved ones, all around us
All our loved ones watching down on us

It's warm in the window
I'm outside in that morning glow
Just before the sunrise
Morning bird sings a song just for the light
For the light, for the light
For the light, for the light, for the light

And all our loved ones, all around us
All our loved ones watching down on us
On us After we spoke I had a dream that I broke
The teeth from a mouth of a snake
That I choked on the teeth
They were mine all along
I picked up the pieces when I woke up
Put them in a boat made of things that I don't want to see
I blew on the sail
Watched it drift out to sea
The further it drifted the closer it came to me
I can't explain

So I took it apart built a billion boxes
There was only one key

You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is empathy
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh, please stop lying
Stop la la la la la la la
La la la la la...

I put hatred in a box then I locked it
The strongest one I made
I buried it all, grew a tree without thorns
And sat beneath the shade

You might think I'm your enemy
But that don't make you mine
And all I have now is empathy
I wish that you'd stop trying
Oh please stop lying
Please stop la la la la la la
La la la la la...
La la la la la... A billion people died on the news tonight
But not so many cried at the terrible sight
Well, mama said
It's just make believe
You can't believe everything you see

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight

Who's the one to decide that it would be alright
To put the music behind the news tonight
Well mama said
You can't believe everything you hear
The diagetic world is so unclear

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight

The unobtrusive tones on the news tonight
And mama said
Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die?
At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes
Mama said
It's just make believe
You can't believe everything you see

So baby, close your eyes to the lullabies
On the news tonight Well i woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Yes I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin' me
Everything's gonna be alright

Well so long, good friends
When will we meet again?
I said so long good friends
When will we meet again?
Well i don't know, i don't know
But I guess I'll see you then...

Well I'm gonna pack my old guitar
Move on down the road
I'm gonna pack my old guitar
And move on down the road (where you gonna go?)
Where I'll go, I don't know
But I guess I've got to go

When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
When I woke up this morning
A rainbow filled the sky
Well that was God tellin me
Everything...Everything is gonna be alright.... Mercury's in retrograde
Don't believe a thing I say
You know I don't believe that stuff
My mind's only made of dust
The echo always said get real
Mostly I just go by feel
Kick it first if it don't start
Don't need tools I got my heart

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control

When Saturn returns I begin
To trust in patterns more than men
Or the stories that they tell
Even when they tell them well
The echo always sounded good
Until I finally understood
I only had to open the door
Now I don't trust the echo anymore

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control

All these planets pulling me around
They pulled my face into a frown
Even though my minds made up
My mind's only made of dust
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen
From stars and clouds and oceans all unseen

Are we free or afraid
Of what we're told
Are we out of or under
Control Looking at himself, but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall, they don't look like him at all

So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he isn't loved at all

He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies
But the ladies don't love him at all
Because when he's not drunk
He's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve
To say he needs a decent girl



All caught up in the trends
Well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know man
There's just no truth left at all
Because when the pretty girl walks
She walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs
Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it isn't this, then its that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly

Well I'm an energetic, hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides, there's nothing in here Well based on your smile
I'm betting all of this
Might be over soon
But your bound to win
Because if I'm betting against you
I think I'd rather lose
But this is all that I have

So please
Take what's left of this heart and use
Please use only what you really need
You know I only have so little
So please
Mend your broken heart and leave

I know it's not your style
I can tell by the way that you move
It's real, real soon
But I'm on your side
And I don't want to be your regret
I'd rather be your cocoon
But this is all that you have


You said this was all you had
And it's all I need
But blah blah blah
Because it fell apart and
I guess it's all you knew
And all I have
But now we have
Only confused hearts and
I guess all we have
Is really all we need Mother, mother ocean, well I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
'Cause you've seen it all, you've seen it all
Watched the men who rode you switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you hold the treasures that few have ever seen
Most of 'em dreams, most of 'em dreams
Yes I am a pirate, a few hundred years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothing to plunder
I'm an under-forty victim of fate
Arriving too late, arriving too late
I've done a bit of smuggling, I've run my share of weed
And I've made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
It's never meant to last, it's never meant to last
And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I've passed out and I've rallied and I've sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishing, got to go fishing
Down to rock bottom again
With just a few friends, just a few friends
With just a few friends, just a few friends I can change the world
With my own two hands
Make it a better place
With my own two hands
Make it a kinder place
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands

I can make peace on earth
With my own two hands
I can clean up the earth
With my own two hands
I can reach out to you
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands

I'm going to make it a brighter place
With my own two hands
I'm going to make it a safer place
With my own two hands
I'm going to help the human race
With my own two hands

With my own
With my own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands

I can hold you
In my own two hands
I can comfort you
With my own two hands
But you've got to use
Use your own two hands

Use your own
Use your own two hands
Use your own
Use your own two hands
With our own
With our own two hands
With our own
Our own two hands
With my own
With my own two hands I don't care if it rains or freezes
As long as i've got my plastic jesus
Sitting on the dashboard of my car
It comes in colours pink and pleasant
It glows in the dark cause its iradescent
I'll take it with me whenever i go far
So give me my lady madonna
Dressed in rhinestones and sittin on a
Pedestal of abalone shells
Drivin 90 but im not scared
Because i've got my virgin mary
Assuring me that i will never go to hell
And by the way
You know the hope will make you strange
Make you blink make you blank make you sink
It will make you afraid of change
And often blame
The box with the view of the world
And the ones who fill the frame
I turn it up but then I turn it off
Because I can't stand when they start to talk
About the hurt and the killing
And the shoes that we're filling
The damage and ruin
Man the things that we're doing
We gotta stop, we gotta turn it all off
We gotta rewind and start it up again
Because we fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
Somebody saw him jump, yeah
But nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope
And then he lost a grip
But now heï¿½s lying in the freeway
In the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one
Just like the other one
Optimistic hypocrite
That didnï¿½t have the nerve to quit
The things that kept him wanting more
He finally reached the core
Because we fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
We fell across the fall line
Ainï¿½t there nothing sacred any more?
All my friends are gettin' older
I guess i must be too
Without their love and kindness
I - I don't know what I'll doooo oh
The wine bottle's half empty
The money's all been spent
We're a cross between our parents and
Hippies in a tent oh
Love calls just like a wild bird
It's just another day
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away
In a mucked-up lovely river
I cast my little fly
But i look at that river and i smell it
And it makes me want to cry oh
To clean our dirty planet
Now there's a noble wish
Now i'm puttin' my shoulder to the wheel
'cause i wanna catch some fish
Love calls just like a wild bird
It's just another day
Spring wind blew my list of
Things to do away If you could read my mind
You'd say baby you're right
And I don't want to fight anymore
You're usually righter than I am
And I'm not a very good fighter
Am I? No, neither are you
So let's be through with this one
Because some things never change

I know you're still my same girl
Who builds her own frames
For the pictures that she paints
The lights of Monterrey
Coming across the bay
Right back to my same girl
Uhmmm hmmm hmmmm
Uhmmm hmmmm hmmmm

How can you be so calm when the truth is that sometimes
We live in the eye of the storm
With everything going on around us
I feel comfort in the sounds when you say
It will be okay
Like a star guiding me to the light of the day
 could follow me

But not with my same girl
Who builds her own frames
For the pictures that she paints
The lights of Monterrey
Coming across the bay
Right back to my same girl
Uhmmm hmmm hmmmm
Uhmmm hmmmm hmmmm Well, I'm just people watching
The other people watching me
And we're all people watching
The other people watching we
We're as lonely as we want it to be
We're all as lonely as we want it to be
Just as lonely as we want it to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

Well, there really ain't no use in stopping
What nobody never told me not to do
So I'll keep people watching, watching me now
Finding my way back to you

But we're as lonely as we want it to be
We're all as lonely as we want it to be
I'm just as lonely as I want it to be
I'm just you, you're just me
It's only true if we believe

I see so many feet going so many ways
People passing by, they got nothing to say
All on our own, just watching and confused
But if nobody told me what to do
I can't stop breaking all the rules

Now, I'm just people watching
Other people watching me
We're all people watching
Other people watching we
And we're as lonely as we want it to be
We're not so lonely as we want it to be
I'm just as lonely as I want it to be
Not so lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonely All I need is a little sun
Some for me some for everyone
All I need is a little air
Some for me some for everywhere
Little bit of love
Little bit of love
And all I need is some water to drink
Quiet place so I can sit and think
And I find me a pot of gold
I'll never forget about the rain (bow)

Little bit of love

Really what I'm trying to say
Is I need you
And every little bit of love
You give me too
And all I need is a happy home
Some place I wouldn't have to be alone
It'll be nice to have some candle light
Light the fire in your heart at night

Little bit of love
Not that we need it
Little bit of love
No need be greedy
Little bit of love
Because I love this treaty
Little bit of love
Not that we need it By the way
You know that hope will make you strange
Make you blink make you blank make you sink
It will make you afraid of change
And often blame
The box with the view of the world
And the walls that fill the frame
I turn it up but then I turn it off
Because I can't stand when they start to talk
About the hurting and killing
Whose shoes are we filling
The damage and ruin
And the things that we're doing
We got to, we got to stop, we got to turn it all off
We got to rewind and start it up again

Because we fell across the fall line
Ain't there nothing sacred anymore
Na, na, na
Na, na, na, na

Somebody saw him jump
Yeah but nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope
And then he lost his grip
Now he's lying in the freeway
In the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one
Just like the other one
Optimistic hypocrite
That didn't have the nerve to quit
The things that kept him wanting more
Until he finally reached the core I've got a symbol in my driveway
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
I've got you a brand new weapon
Lets see how destructive we can be
I've got a brand new set of stencils
I've been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a zip lock bag
Lets see how unproductive we can be
I've got a light bulb full of anger
And I can switch it on and off
In situations it can be so bright
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
I've got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm going to build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth?
I've got a phosphorescent secret
But don't you tell nobody else
Next thing you know, the whole world
Will be talking about all the clues they got
They're just no use, they've got us fooled Oh, you're such a pretty thing
I'll take you and I'll make you all mine
I will steal you from this patient world let it chase us
It could never take you back

We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
It's not ours

And I know you know me well enough
To know I'm lucky to have you
But all this just the little things
The words that I should tell you all the time
You're so sweet to me
When you beat me in doubles solitaire
You're so sweet to me
In a world that's not always fair

We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
We could watch it from the clouds
We can't stop it anyhow, it's not ours
It's not ours

More love that you feel
More your little heart will ache
Love's the only thing that carries on
It's the only thing this world can't take

This love is ours
This love is ours
This love is ooh ooh ooh!
This love is ooh ooh ooh ooh!

Oh you're such a pretty thing, I'll take you and I'll make you all mine Are they laughing at or with me?
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes
I think that I'm so happy now
And I think this is a better you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Are they laughing at or with me?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Why can't we just say what we mean?

People are just trying to fit in
But is this something telling you?
You can't trust anyone in this town
Aww, baby, those are such great shoes


Don't put your money where your mouth is, baby
We don't want to see you choke
Nobody's choking around here anymore
Nobody's broken any high scores

No dancing shoes have touched this dusty floors
For such a long, long time
For such a long, long time
For such a long time


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  Some of us need to gather
And others gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?

If anybody finds a flame
You gotta keep it safe and dry
If anybody goes for coffee
Well, then, give me a piece of the pie, a little piece of the pie
And then we gotta try to harvest
Somebody's gonna have to till
And what about a little shelter?
What about a big house on the hill?
And who's gonna tend the garden
If the rain forgets to fall?
And who's gonna spend
As much as they can
On Jesus at the mall?

Some of us need to gather
And others gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?

Now we got ourselves a circus
Let's put it away for a while
We'll bring it back if we get hungry
Or just fashionably out of style
And who's gonna try to fix this one?
Somebody please stop the car
And who's gonna give me some good news and
Who's gonna take it too far?
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too far
Come on, let's take it too

Some of us need to gather
And other's are gonna have to kill
With everybody so preoccupied, who's gonna pay the bills?
Well some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Some of us need to gather (some of us need to gather)
Who's gonna pay the bills (come on, let's take it too far)
Who's gonna pay the bills
Come on, let's take it too far
Who's gonna pay the
Come on let's take it too far
Who's gonna pay the You walk into the world you make
You lose yourself but you find your way
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
We turn so slow I know it's hard to wait
Take your time, sun is yours to take
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream

I see you lost in what you create
All of time in this one single day
You take it in and you
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Radiate
Follow your hands as they build
As they shape, as they follow your mind
And rose like a wave
Take it and you
Radiate
Radiate
I'm going to watch you
Radiate
Radiate

These rocks they hold heat
Pools of water cool your feet
As you walk you believe
Every part of the dream As I was saying
Just before you left the room before
Before I assumed
That you might not come around
As I was saying
Just after I took my foot from
My mouth and put it back
On the ground

Well I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

This is worth saving
Cause the sum of us is more than us
If you add us up
Then subtract my lack of sleep
My mind feels crazy
When all these thoughts come rushing in
Should I be trusting them
Or only let them be?

Cause I don't want to disappoint you
And I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

Is it just a matter of time?
Does it even matter at all?
Cause even if this story should fall
From the sky to the sea
If I should fall
Would you fall down with me?
Would you fall with me?
Found my foundation
It was underneath me all alone
On this path I'm on
Now I never walk alone
I've been erasing
Rewrote the second half like this
So my protagonist
Might find his way back home

And I don't want to disappoint you
I don't want to disappear
From here or now or you

No not from here or now or you No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try
Street lamps are broken
Black the way I came
Who broke the moonlight
Watch it wax and wane
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try

Let's not get ahead of ourselves now
There's no need for rain
Its our own parade
Let's not be afraid of our reflections
Its not only you
You're looking at now

Road signs were stolen
Left here holding this flame
Who stole my patience
Who stole my way
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try


You're looking at now
Who you looking at now
Who you looking at now

No good with faces
And I'm bad with names
Gave me directions
But it's all the same
I'm lost
I'm too tired to try The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well, maybe it's just time to say
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seems to stay

Future complications
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away

Thingama jigsaw puzzled
Anger, don't you step too close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Hallelujah zig-zag nothing
Misery it's on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Sometimes it makes you want to yell

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade away

Fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games
Then one foggy Christmas eve
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? ""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee (yippee)
""Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history. ""
Well Rudolph he didn't go for that
He said ""I see through your silly games""
How could you look me in the face
When only yesterday you called me names?
Well all of the other reindeers man
Well they sure did feel ashamed
""Rudolph you know we're sorry
We're truly gonna try to change"" It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone

If you have two
Give one to your friend
If you have three
Give one to your friend and me
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
If you have one
Here is something you can learn
You can still share
Just by taking turns
If you've got a ball
Bounce it to the gang
If there is a new kid
Invite him out to hang
If you've got one sandwich
Cut that thing in half
If you know a secret joke
Tell it and share a laugh
If you've got one drumstick
Give one to your friend
Make one beautiful rhythm
Share a beat that never ends
And if you're feeling lonely
Share time with your mom
Share some milk and cookies
And sing the sharing song

It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone
It's always more fun
To share with everyone I got a faulty parachute
I got a stranger's friend
An exciting change in
My butchers blend
A symbol on the ceiling
With the flick of a switch
My new found hero
In the enemy's ditching
Well somebody's something was left in the room
And man, now that its gone, well, of course we assume
That somebody else needed something so bad
That they took everything that somebody had

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

The mark was left
Man, it's never the same
Next time that you shoot
Make sure that you aim
Open windows with passing cars
A brand new night
With the same old stars

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

Feed the fool
A piece of the pie
Make a fool of his system
Make a fool of his mind
Give him bottles of lies
And maybe he'll find
His place in heaven
Because he might just die

Losing hope is easy
When your only friend is gone
And every time you look around
Well, it all, it all just seems to change

But hanging on is easy
When you've got a friend to call
When nothings making sense at all
You're not the only one that's afraid of change Just when you were getting used to this place
You were getting used to these bones
You were getting used to the changes
Well the change won't leave you alone
You finally caught up with the pace
The tough just might have got going
You thought you could trust all the faces
Well they're only on one side of the coin

All these changes
Different stages
Turning page after page after page
It gets stranger day by day

Set your eyes straight up ahead
Don't look down when you cross
And pay no mind to time it's a punch line
The joke is on all of us Well he's not necessarily trying to say that he minds it
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
Well he's not necessarily trying to say god can't be trusted
But someone plays evil tricks on that kid
And certain situations scream for deviations
But somehow he always gets stuck in the middle
Of this and that and man he should try less
Because every time he's rejected, man, he loses affection

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Well I know some people's they got a little less than nothing
But still find some to spare
And other people got more than they could use
But they don't share
And some people got problems man
They got awful complications
Other people got perfect situations
With no provocation

But don't we all, don't we just got to give a little time
Maybe give a friend a call instead of making him confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you
Confused
What a terrible thing for you to do
What an awful thing for you to say
What a terrible thing for you to relay

Somehow we always get stuck in the middle
Confused, what an awful thing for you to do
Confused, what an awful thing for you to say Yes In high seas or-a low seas, I'm gonna be your friend
You know that I'm gonna be your friend. And is a
In-a high tide or-a low tide, I'll be by your side
You know that I'll be by your side
(I heard her praying - praying - praying)
I said, I heard my mother
She was praying (praying - praying - praying); in the night
And the words that she said (the words that she said)
They still-a lingers in my head (lingers in my head)
She said: A child is born into this world, He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we're wrong, please correct us (when we're wrong, correct us)
Bb | C
And stand by me, in these
High seas or-a low seas, I'm gonna be your friend
You know that I'm gonna be your friend. And is a
In-a high tide or-a low tide, I'll be by your side
You know that I'll be by your side
I said, I heard my mother
She was cryin' (I heard her cryin', cryin', cryin') in the night
And the tears that she shed (the tears that she shed)
They still-a lingers in my head (lingers in my head)
She said: A child is born into this world, He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we're wrong, please correct us (when we're wrong, correct us)
And stand by me, in these
High seas or-a low seas, I'm gonna be your friend
You know that I'm gonna be your friend. And is a
In-a high tide or-a low tide, I'll be by your side
You know that I'll be by your side Tied down against the tracks
Screaming in silent, black and white
Why'd you trust us? We are such villains
We would tell ourselves anything
We want to hear, if we are willing
To listen is to learn
Then too much is what we deserve

And how come when we say that we do
We don't
Pray to anybody you want
We won't

But if we're the ones to blame then the fruit
Shouldn't taste so good, we were used
Used to thinking we got nothing to lose
We're losing everything but the truth
Walking straight into a roadblock
Ending left, here bending
Your point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse

With all its do's and don'ts
The future is an empty promise
Unconcerned and so tired of waiting
We could sell it wooden horses
Full of nightmares and when they open
This all might recompose
There's no going back to the good old days
It's just a phase bring in some new life
Archaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere When you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

And if you are waiting, waiting for me
Know I'll be home soon darling I guarantee
I'll be home Sunday just in one week
Dry up your tears if you start to weep

And sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself

Lullaby, I'm not nearby
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Don't you cry, no don't you cry
Sing this lullaby to yourself

'Cause when I arrive dear it won't be that long
No it won't seem like anytime that I've been gone
It ain't the first time, it won't be the last
Won't you remember these words to help the time pass?
So when you're so lonely lying in bed
Night's closed it's eyes but you can't rest your head
Everyone's sleeping all through the house
You wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby to yourself
Sing this lullaby, sing this lullaby
Sing this lullaby to yourself If they tell me that the bees
Don't make honey anymore
Then what am I supposed to tell you
And if they tell me that the ocean
Is tired of her shores
Then tell me
What am I supposed to tell you?

When I can't tell you anything
But the truth
I can tell you anything
But the truth

What happens to an eagle's nest in a storm
How does the mama
Keep the baby warm
What if the wind
Is telling us that its time
And what if we're not ready to fly


Tree tops they touch the ground
In the morning walk with no sound
Hear no birds, hear no planes
Through the mud, feel the clay
Build it up, make it sing
Make it strong, give it wings


What is this place?
Who am I?
Why did we come here?

I don't know, I don't know
But I don't know
That we're meant to know It feels right
It feels wrong
It feels like when you have it, then it's gone
I want more
More and more
And if you steal the fire
Give me some

Because the sun
Disobeys while it waits for a friend to arrive from the past
What holds us around, and around
While we wait Well don't give me no comic book sad looks no more
Please don't use those same excuses you've used before
Mmm hmmm! Mmm hmmm!
You told yourself so many times it's okay
So eager to try
But you just don't know how to come back down

And now you beat me up, you break me down
Hoping I don't come around
Kick me when I'm on the ground
Beat me up, break me down
Hoping I don't come around
Kick me when I'm on the ground

Well how about those people I know that you know the ones I mean
Not so good, not so bad
Only know what they have
And they have only what they've seen
Them mediocre bad guys can really bring you down
They can't be defeated, and you know
They're never going to come around Saturday morning and it's time to go
One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese homeruns over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would remain
Nothing's going to change, there's no need to complain

Sunday morning and it's time to go
Been raining all night so everybody knows
Over to the field for tackle football
Big hits, big hats, yeah give me the ball
Rain is pouring, touchdown scoring
Keep on rolling, never boring
Karma, karma, karma chameleon
We're talking kinda funny from helium


Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a pa-diddle with a burnt-out fuse
Well my best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
  Everybody is made of clay
That's what they used to say
Until the truth stepped on us all
Now everything that was big is small
We're just little crying robots
Program me
I wanna win the race
I wanna find the place
Where the king
Locked up the princess
Jump the fence
And drink a little bit of

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now who is the king of the sky
Jupiter says oh me oh my oh why
Is the game always changing
I've been through some strangeness
What's the matter
Is the feast not fat enough
Up the ladder with your feet
Reaching with your hands
You can feel it and dream it
I know you want to believe it
Just steal it
Take a piece of the sun
And drink some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology

Now everybody's in the play
At least that's what the script
Told me to say
I'd say
Shadows cut across the hero's face
He falls from grace
Until a little bird sang
The truth is never ending
We're just here pretending
Let's all laugh so that we don't cry
Let's all lift our glasses up to the sky
For some

Red wine, mistakes, apologies
Red wine, headaches, mythology On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
Mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner real nice
Beef stew on the stove, lomi salmon with the ice
We eat & drink and we sing all day
Kanikapila in the old Hawaiian way
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
We go grandma's house on the weekend clean yard
If we no go, grandma gotta work hard
You know my grandma, she like the poi real sour
I love my grandma every minute, every hour
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
Mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner real nice
Beef stew on the stove, lomi salmon with the ice
We eat & drink and we sing all day
Kanikapila in the old Hawaiian way
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
On the Island, we do it Island Style
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side
From the mountain to the ocean from the windward to the leeward side I don't want you to go
I don't want you to go

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

I don't want you to know
Let's not go sleep tonight
It's not that it goes too fast
It's just that it goes at all

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

Why should I be sad when I'm just you?
Why should I be sad? Baby, I'm with you
Baby, I'm with you

But it's time to turn your love
Give it back
And it's time to turn your love
Give it back, give it back
Give it back

Give it back, give it back, give it back How many times must we go through this?
You've always been mine, woman, I thought you knew this
How many times must we go through this?
You'll always be mine, Cupid only misses sometimes
But we could end up broken-hearted
If we don't remember why this all started
And if they try to tell you love fades with time
Tell them there's no such thing as time
It's our time When you grab a hold of me
Tell me that I’ll never be set free
But I’m a parasite, creep and crawl
I step into the night
Two pints of booze
Tell me are you a badfish too? are you a badfish too?
Ain’t got no money to spend
And I hope this night will never end
Lord knows I’m weak
Won’t somebody get me off of this reef
And baby your a big blue whale
I'll grab the reef when all duck diving fails
And I can swim but I wish I had never learned
Cuz the water’s too polluted with germs
Dive deep when it’s ten feet overhead
And grab the reef, that's underneath my bed
It’s underneath my bed
Ain’t got no quarrels with God, ain’t got no time to grow old
Lord knows that I’m weak
Won’t somebody get me off of this reef
And there’s a steel train comin’ in, I would take it if I could
And I would not lie to you, because Sunday mornin’ soon will come
Things will be, easier to say
Upon the microphone like I'm a Boss DJ
I will walk up upon the stage, like it was dry land
A Boss DJ ain’t nothin’ but a man
No trouble, no fuss, I know why..
It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice
It’s so nice I wanna hear the same song twice
Nowadays all the songs on the radio
They all
All drive me crazy Brushfire fairytales
Itsy bitsy diamond wells
Big fat hurricanes
Yellow bellied given names
Well shortcuts can slow you down
And in the end we're bound
To rebound off of we
Well dust off your thinking caps
Solar powered plastic plants
Pretty pictures of things we ate
We are only what we hate
But in the long run we have found
Silent films are full of sound
Inaudibly free
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Inaudible melodies
Serve narrational strategies
Unobtrusive tones
Help to notice nothing but the zone
Of visual relevancy
Frame-lines tell me what to see
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Well Plato's cave is full of freaks
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen
And just slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Slow down everyone
You're moving too fast
Frames can't catch you when
You're moving like that
Moving Too.... When I look up at the stars
As I walk in the night
Down the street by my house
It feels good

The light from the moon
Is afraid of the ground
So it falls behind spaces
And hides behind clouds

When I look up at the clouds
As they move through the night
With the wind
As I walk down the street They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say every man who needs protection
They say every man must fall
But I swear I can see my reflection
Some where so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Yondah stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him crying out so loud
Crying cause he was framed
And the say I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking
Pictures of people taking pictures

I pictured us at the end of time
Holding up a camera to our eyes
I took a picture of you took a picture of me
In the back ground of the picture
Was water running to the sea

So I pictured us standing there
Staying away from time
Watching it like a river
As it slowly washes by


The feed back loop
Is closing in so tight
Surrounding ourselves
With satellites We could be here all night long...all night
This is a brokedown melody for the wooodshed
I hope this old train breaks down
And i could take a walk around
You see there's no time you see
Cause time is just melody
With all the people in the street
Walking fast as their feet can take them
I might just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
The frame i'm lookin through
Seems to have no concern for miles
For now I
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
Well this engine screams out loud
Sayin the P gonna crawl westbound
And i don't even make a sound cuz
Gonna sting me when i leave this town
All the people in the street
That i never get to meet
These tracks gonna bend somehow
And i got no time
That i got to get
To where i don't need to be, so i
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
Break on down
I gotta break on down
But you can't stop nothin
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
That you don't know nothin
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass window's
You can't stop wishin
If you dont let go
Of the things that you find
And you lose and you know
You keep on rollin
Put the moment on hold
But the frames still bright
With the blinds down low
And I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
I need this
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me just breakdown
Oh, let me break on Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like boys play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free
And someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found out what life is really worth
Then there will be peace on Earth
Someday all of our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you or for me
But someday at Christmas time
And someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
In one shining moment my heart ran away
From the world that we live in today
And someday at Christmas, men will not fail
Take all because your love will prevail
Someday in a new world that we can only start
With hope in every heart
And someday all of our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you or for me
But someday at Christmas time
There will be peace on Earth
I said there will be peace on Earth Some will say
This place is wrong
These hands are fast
This face is long

Just stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These plans are torn
These feet are cold
This shield is worn
This peace was stolen

Stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These problems they breathe
Their fire is real
And the coins that they keep
You cannot steal

Even when you're asleep
They'll be here still
Breathing out or in

Some will say this place is gone
These roads are steep
And much too long

These plans are cheap
My feet are cold
Cut the knot
These coins are golden

Some will say this place is gone
These roads are steep
And much too long

These plans are cheap
My feet are cold
Cut the knot
These coins are golden

Stop upsetting yourself
Upsetting your thoughts
Upsetting this world
That you're standing on

These problems they breathe
Their fire is real
And the coins that they keep
You cannot steal

Even when you're asleep
They'll be here still
Just breathing out or in Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama, you been on my mind
I don't mean trouble
Please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleadin' or sayin', ""I can't forget""
I do not walk the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet
Mama, you been on my mind
An' even though my mind is hazy
An' my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Nor bring me down in sorrow
It don't even matter where you're wakin' up tomorrow
'Cause mama, you'll be on my mind
Well I'm not askin' you to say words
Like 'Yes' or 'No'
Please understand me
I have no place I'm callin' you t' go
Just whisperin' to myself
So I can't pretend that I don't know
But mama, you been on my mind
When you wake up in the mornin'
Baby, look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you
You know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know
If you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind
---------------
It's when yer head gets twisted or yer mind grows numb
You think you're too old, too young, too smart, too dumb
Laggin' behind or losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
Wind's got you sideways, one hand holdin' on
The other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
Wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
Lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you can feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer hands are a-slidin', rope is a-drippin'
Your sidewalk starts crawlin' and your streak is too long
And you start walkin' backwards but you know this is wrong
Sunny deserts and your evergreen valleys
Turn the broken-down slums and trashcan alleys
Your sky cries water and your drain pipes are pourin'
Lightning’s a-flashin' and your thunder’s a-crashin'
Windows are rattlin' and breakin'
And your rooftop, well it starts shakin'
And your whole world is all
Slammin' and bangin' Saturday morning and it's time to go
One day these could be the days but who could have known
Loading in the back of a pickup truck
Riding with the boys and pushing the luck
Singing songs loud on the way to the game
Wishing all the things could still be the same
Chinese homeruns over the backstop
Kakua on the ball and soda pop well...

Nothing's gonna change there's no need to complain
Monday morning and it's time to go
Wet trunks and schoolbooks and sand on my toes
Do anything you can to dodge the bus-stop blues
Like driving a padiddle with a burnt-out fuse
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
So meet her by the sugar mill after school
My best friend Kimi wants to go with you
Meet her by the sugar mill after school
We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought

We used to laugh a lot
But only because we thought
That everything good always would
Everything good always would remain Hey... I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I'm gonna give it a fight
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Well now....I'm gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry
Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free
Set the children free
Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination
Set the children free
Set the children free The city is my jungle gym

The city's nitty gritty but it's so much fun
We can take a ride go tell everyone
It's a jungle gym

These streets have got a rhythm
It's a funky beat
The more I find inside the city
The more I find in me
It's a jungle gym

Movie theatres and museums
Fishing in the pond

Well I forgot, he's not the teachers son
No he's just the reason for her to say
That she needs a substance in her today
Well who's to say he's not going to see the sun
Well I forgot he's not the gifted one
No he's just a, another version of his dad
He'll learn to love things that he never
All he ever does is walk alone
Man he can only walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need nowhere to hide
I know she is all that he ever loved at 17
Too bad to her he was a passing thing only temporary
Until she finds someone with everything
Cause she's what we might call a sugar-queen
See her whole scene consists of diamond rings
But that's okay, probably better anyway
Cause now that he's free she might finally see that
All he ever does is walk alone
Man he can only walk so far before
All he ever does is look inside
He don't need nowhere to hide

Girl you look good, so good to me
I want you to stay
I don't want you to leave
Don't go, don't go

Don't go, don't go
I love every lil' thing about you baby
Don't ya know?
Ohhh, look whatcha did Well I'm a-runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind
Four that want to own me, two that want to stone me
One says she's a friend of mine
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy
Well, I'm a-standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
Such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat-bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me
Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win, though we will never be here again
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy
Well, I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find
Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
Oh, we got it easy
We outghta take it easy There must be a forecast that you won't let yourself see
So you keep watching as you're drifting, sail away from what you need
Why don't I just give you everything you'll take from me?
Cause nobody owns anything and everyone is free

And that's why this ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on

God fearing people at the bottom of the sea
Walking without lanterns, let a stone skip over thee
Hi-ho away as in the sea
Hi-ho be gone
So let's just dance
We'll waltz above the ocean

And that's why this ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on
Let it be sung so we
Let it be sung so we could carry on

I've heard all of the stories and in them I've put my trust
You've got to touch the bottom before you can come back up
And I know what you're heart is telling you
Cause my heart's telling me the same thing too

This ship is going down
Desperately, I need a sound
A song to sing so we can carry on
Just let it be sung so we can carry on
Let it be sung so we
Let it be sung so we could carry on Well somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named the Rocky Raccoon
One day his woman ran off with another guy
He hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that. He said ""Well I'ma get that boy.""
So one day he walked into town
And booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon, he checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, but she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
Well she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, he said
""Danny boy, this is a showdown.""
But Danny was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner. Ah...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doctor came in and stinking of gin
Proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky you met your match.""
He said, ""No, Doc, you know it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, Doc
I will be better as soon as I am able.""
So Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
But only to find Gideon's Bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo...
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo
Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo... Mother, mother ocean, I have heard you call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You've seen it all, you've seen it all
Watched the men who rode you they switch from sails to steam
In your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of 'em dreams, most of 'em dreams
Yes I am a pirate, two-hundread years too late
The cannons don't thunder, there's nothin' to plunder
I'm an over-forty victim of fate
Arrivin' too late, arrivin' too late
I've done a bit of smugglin', I've run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami, but I pissed it away so fast
Never meant to last, never meant to last
And I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I passed out and I rallied and I sprung a few leaks
But I got stop wishin', I've got to go fishin'
Down to rock bottom again
Just a few friends, just a few friends
Just a few friends, just a few friends Who's to say
He's not the gifted one
Well, I forgot
He's not the teacher's son
Well, he's just a
Reason for her to say that
She needs a

Well, who's to say
He's not gonna see the sun
Well, I forgot

No, he's just a

Who loved to love things
That he never

Many can only

He don't need no where to hide
I know she is
All that he ever loved
At seventeen
Too bad to her he was

Lordy how they could love
They vowed to love one another
Or baith beneith the stars above
It was her man...
But he was doing her wrong
Well Frankie went down to the bar room
To fetch her self a bucket of beer
The bartender said mrs frankie
Ur loving mans been here
It was ur man... (hey hey hey hey)
But he was doing u wrong
The bartender said Mrs Frankie
Well girl i can't tell u no lies
Your husband left about an hour ago
With that hussy named Nelly Bly
It was ur man...
But he was doing u wrong
Well Frankie she cried, she cried, she cried
She said lordy wat have i done
I done give enough love to my man 
He done took my love and run
It was my man...
But he was doing me wrong
Well Albert saw Frankie coming
He said lordy dont you shoot
But out from under that red camona
The gun went rooty-toot toot
She shoot that man...
Cuz he was doing her wrong
Aboo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo boo-hoo
She said baby wat have i done
I done shoot the only man i love
With a colt 41
I shot my man...
Cause he was doing me wrong
Now Frankie and Albert were sweethearts
Lordy how they could love
They vowed to love one and other
Or bath beneith the stars above
It was her man...
But he was doing her wrong The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well maybe it's just time to say
Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seem to stay
Future complication
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far
Things can go bad
And make you wanna run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade, fade, fade
Thingamajigsaw puzzled
Anger don't you step to close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Well hallelujah zigzag nothing
Misery is on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Sometimes it makes you want to yell
Things can go bad
And make you wanna run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade, fade, fade I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
Wears a smile that can make me wanna sing

She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She can make angels
Seen it with my own eyes
You gotta be careful when you've got good love
'Cause then angels will just keep on multiplying

Aw, but you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile and you could change all of mine
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
We share the same soul
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh ohhh
Oh oh oh Free
(Donavon Frankenreiter & Jack Johnson)
Well we could
Let this love be the fading sky
And we could 
Drift all night until the new sunrise
Pass me a drink, or maybe two
One for me and one for you
And we'll be
Free, free, free, free
Here comes corner winds and the changing tides
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait
Until the trade winds blow
When we'll be
Free, free, free, free
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
What we are, we are just
On a lifeboat sailing home
With our, drunken hearts and our tired bones
Well I just take one last look around
Yeah, an' every place feels like a familiar town
And now we're
Free, free
And don't you wanna be
Free
From time to time a little
Free
Hey now, now
Free
I know you know you're
Free
Feels so good to be
Free
Mmm, mmm, mmm In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dying ember
And only memories remain
And through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain Running just as fast as you can
You jump ship wake wake (??) but maybe it's thicker
Than water
I got some good news for you my friend
The man is faster
You jump ship wake wake (??) but maybe it's thicker
Than water
One day you wake up and realize
Just what you're after Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all
So he ties it up, he tucks it in, he pulls it back, and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all
He gets his courage from the can
It makes him feel like a man
Because he's loving all the ladies
But the ladies don't love him at all
Cause when he's not drunk
He's only stuck on himself
And then he has the nerve
To say he needs a decent girl
Looking at herself but wishing she was someone else
Because the body of the doll it don't look like hers at all
So she straps it on, she sucks it in, she throws it up, and gives a grin
Laughing at herself because she knows she ain't that at all
All caught up in the trends
Well the truth began to bend
And the next thing you know, man
There just ain't no truth left at all
Cause when the pretty girl walks
She walks so proud
And when the pretty girl laughs
Oh man, she laughs so loud
And if it ain't this then its that
As a matter of fact
She hasn't had a day to relax
Since she has lost her ability to think clearly
Well I'm a superficial, systematic, music television addict
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Well I'm an energetic hypothetic version of another person
Check out my outsides there ain't nothing in here
Here comes another one, just like the other one
Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else
Because the posters on the wall they don't look like a him
And so he ties it up he tucks it in, he pulls it back and gives a grin
Laughing at himself because he knows he ain't loved at all
He knows he ain't loved at all When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losin' yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's mornin' seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' 'cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slammin' and bangin'
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're lookin' for somethin' you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watchin' with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're fryin'
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blindin' dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled white facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's makin you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when your layin' in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closin with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doin'
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strummin', in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm hummin', in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinkin'
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know why they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
""Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flyin' train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rollin' long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
""Cause you look an' you start getting the chills
""Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you thinks it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache'
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while 'cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't even yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital
And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown If we took a holiday
A little time to get away
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
G Love:
Check it out yo
I dishwash hip hop non stop
Down to New Zealand and you feel the beat drop
We work so hard just to live and survive
Were just lucky like y'all feeling the vibe
From my feets to my toes you know how it goes
I eat beats like snacks, fat tracks and microphones
Lay back like jack with a glass of merlot
And you know I’m going bust with that funky ass flow
So my spider sense is starting to tingle
I’ma eat it up like a booty called single
From Aukland to Japan around the world
In a rush my girl says that I work too much
Soon im going to crash like a tidal wave
And I fall on the beach cause it’s a holiday
And chill in the shade cause im lemonade
Well my name is G. Love and that’s my brother Jack J
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
Holiday
Celebrate
It would be so nice
I walked 37 miles of barbed wire
I got a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made outta rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
So come on darling take a little walk with me
Now tell me now who do you love?
Who do you love?
I said who do you love?
Jack J:
Focus on this the introductionist
Yeah more the lyricist in this rap metropolis
More like an activist who will give it to you all
Presentation will make you have a ball
Sounds start conceiving causing you to meditate
Manipulate the lines with hypnotic modern state
We far from the fakes
Cause we never fake moves
But jealous mofos since the justice approves
And who the hell he be having a fit
Well he ain’t got sh-
That’s why he’s in crips
And I identify that it rips
Business of nonsense nothing less than BS(west side)
And who can reign with the all around remainders
A true entertainer
Revival of the true art form of hip hop
Explore non-stop
Entertain ya till ya drop
Well who do you love?
I say who do you love? Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You'll accompany me
When I look back
Your love was like the sun
And I don't remember no cold days only warm warm sun
Further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me
Further on down the road, baby
You'll accompany me
And if we are in fools in life
Then a happy fool I would rather be
And I'll be glad to learn from you
And I know that you will learn from me
And I don't care where they came from
And I don't care what they must say
Woman you've been loving in my corner all all the way
So further on down the road, baby
You will accompany me And by the way you know the hope will make you strange
Make you blink, make you blink, make you sink
It will make you afraid of change and often blame
The box with the view of the world and the ones who fill the frame
I turn it up, but then I turn it off because I can't stand
When they start to talk about the
Hurting and killing who's shoes are we filling
The damage and ruin and the things that we're doing
Got to, we got to stop, we got to turn it all off, we got to
Rewind, start it up again
Because it fell across the fall line
And nothing's sacred anymore
Na na na na na na na na
Somebody saw him jump, yeah but nobody saw him slip
I guess he lost a lot of hope and then he lost his grip
And now he's lying in the freeway in the middle of this mess
Guess we lost another one, just like the other one
Energetic apathetic version of another person
Check out his outsides, ain't nothing in there
He fell across the fall line
And nothing's sacred anymore
Na na na na na na na na They say taylor was a good girl, never one to be late
Complain, express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift, passing out the tickets
Youre gonna have to pay her if you want to park here
Well mommys little dancer has quite a little secret
Working on the streets now, never gonna keep it
Its quite an imposition and now shes only wishing
That she would have listened to the words they said
Poor taylor
She just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds and shell pretend that
Shes somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Peter patrick pitter patters on the window
But sunny silhouette won't let him in
Poor old petes got nothing because hes been falling
Somehow sunny knows just where hes been
He thinks that singing on sunday is gonna save his soul
Now that saturday is gone
Sometimes he thinks that hes on his way
But i can see that his break lights are on
He just wanders around, unaffected by
The winter winds and hell pretend that
Hes somewhere else, so far and clear
About two thousand miles from here
Such a tough enchilada filled up with nada
Giving what she gotta give to get a dollar bill
Used to be a limber chicken, times a been a ticking
Nows shes finger licking to the man
With the money in his pocket flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world
If taylor finds a better world
Then taylor's gonna run away Spoken:
Well, I've got one memory thats always been with me
My dad would get up to go surf about 4:30 or 5:00 and sometimes
I would hear him and go out in the living room and he'd be getting is board up
Out of the closet, like right in the dining
Room where he kept his board
And one day I remember the waves were really good
And um, it was really cool just getting up
And going down there, it was off-shore
I remember just sitting there watching my dad surf and from that point on
I always kinda like.. felt like a surfer, you know?
I always knew that I would definitely.. be surfing forever I don't care what you do
I only care about you
And I don't care what you say
Are you comin my way
And I don't care what your momma say
And I don't care what your poppa say
And I don't care what your friends say
I'm gon love you anyway
Come on and take a ride
Come on and take a ride
:
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
I got to give it to you
When I was all out of luck you brought me the jackpot
All outta luck, the kissin and the hugging
On a nervous breakdown, I'll tell ya little somethin
I wanna thank you babe, you kept me from boogeyin
(Jack Johnson):
Well let me tell you about a girl I met one time
She got the looks and the books, gotta make her mine
She told me things that nobody ever told me
And as she taught me well I learned
That I love all the time we would spend and the nights
Just talkin
In the morning I would leave and then I'd come back
Knockin
For you girl
Always lookin for you girl Well that's alright
And that's alright
2000 miles we stood
And that's alright
And that's alright
If that's alright
I'll see you in the morning
If that's alright
What would you do if i wrote you a song
Would you give me some lovin when i get home
Would you be mad at me if i had a hard time
Gettin a hold of you you know i try all the time
And i think that
You don't know anybody that could be
So bad but if you did
You'd be wonderin where i'm at
Well i'll be home when tomorrow mornin comes
What would you do if i sang you this song
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
When my words kiss your ear
I'll be right there
The message is long
But this is your song
And i think that
You don't know anybody that could be
So bad
But if you did
You'd be wonderin where
I'm at
Well i'll be home when tomorrow mornin...
And that's alright
'cause i'll be home when tomorrow mornin...
And that's allllright
'cause i'll be home when tomorrow mornin comes This is a true story
I think it was a sign
When your cell
Phone fell
Into the toilet
And then it spelled
The word
Goodbye

Backstage at the shell
It was nice enough of it to tell
You farewell
Before
It went
Off to Hell

Well maybe it will see
Our two computers
Down there
That were stolen
On New Years Day
I never really liked them
Anyway Don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
Oh mama don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
You told me go to bed hours ago but
Mama you know I just can't sleep
It's getting late
I just can't close my eyes
Well it's, getting so late
I just can't close my eyes
I'm so afraid if I close my eyes
I just won't see what's outside
You told me go to bed hours ago but
Mama I just can't sleep..... Don't you know
I just can't go to sleep
Oh, mama, don't you know
I just can't go to sleep

You told me go to bed hours ago
But mama, I just can't sleep

It's getting late
I just can't close my eyes
Well, it's getting so late
I just can't close my eyes
I'm so afraid if I close my eyes I just won't see what's outside

You told me go to bed hours ago
But mama, I just can't sleep She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs without her
She's just so mmm
She knows the world is just her stage
And so she'll never misbehave
She gives thanks for what they gave her
Man, they practically made her
Into a mmm
She's the one that stumbles when she talks about
The seven foreign films that she's checked out
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm
She's got it all figured out
She knows what everything's about
And when anybody doubts her
Or sings songs about her
She's just so mmm
She's the one that stumbles when she talks about it
So maybe we shouldn't talk about
Such a fortunate fool
She's just too good to be true
She's such a fortunate fool
She's just so mmm The air was more than human
And the heat was more than hungry
And the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes
The boars were running wild
Because they're big and mean and sacred
And the children playing cricket with no shoes
That morning we woke up man
To a seven-hour drive
Well there we were in South Batong
Where women are men and men go wrong
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
Man and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
The officials were quite friendly
Once we bribed them with our sweet talk
And we drowned them with our cigarettes and booze
Disembarking from the port
With no mistakes of any sort
Moving south the engine running smooth
The next morning we woke up man
With the sunrise to the right well
Moving back north to Port Blair
Where boats break and children stare
And there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven, mmm
Man and there were so many fewer questions
When stars were still just the holes to heaven Found myself thinking of you today
All of your wise comments
And your crooked smile
Saying that the world
Would be a better place
With more Jack Johnson
Flashback to the time
When you were all mine
Golden skin, sky blue eyes
Wishing for the day that you could play
Play the guitar
Just like Jack Johnson

You were my world and you
Moved halfway across it
But I'm your girl, I'm your girl
And nothing can stop it

Cuz I will follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you go (I'll be there too)
Well I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving
And I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow you

I found myself thinking
About summer days
Staying up late laughing and
Memorizing details of your face
Sitting on a porch and
Playing Jack Johnson

Well you were my world
And you moved halfway across it
Well I'm your girl, I'm your girl
And nothing, can stop it

Cuz I will follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you go (I'll be there too)
Well I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving
And I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow you

And if I could
I would go back in time
And tell you don't go
I'd tell you don't go
Come home
Come home
I'm gonna follow
I'll follow (You know I'll follow)
Wherever you may go (I'll be there too)
I'm running, I'm flying, I'm driving (Ah)
I know that I'll get to you someday
If I follow
[Outro}
And I hope you like this song
As much as you like
Jack Johnson Two thousand miles but thats all right
Ill see you in the morning if thats all right
What would you do if i wrote you a song
Would you give me some loving when i get home
Or would you be mad at me if i had a hard time
Getting a hold of you, i try all the time
Ill bet that you dont know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did youd be wondering where im at
Ill be home when tomorrow morning comes
What would you do if i sang you this song
The connection is bad but thats only the phone
When my words kiss your ear, ill be right there
The message is long because baby this is your song
Ill bet that you dont know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did youd be wondering where im at
Ill be home when tomorrow morning comes There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
And our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoe box of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

And love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
And it's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's so much better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together Instrumental I got a symbol in my driveway
I got a hundred million-dollar friends
I got you a brand new weapon
Let's see how destructive we can be
I got a brand new set of stencils
I been connecting all the dots
I got my plans in a zip-locked bag
Let's see how productive we can be
I got a lightbulb full of anger
I can switch it on and off
Situations they can be so bright
I can't believe how pathetic we can be
I got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm gonna build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth
I got a phos-florescent secret
Don't you tell nobody else
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah Secret Heart, what are you made of?
What are you so afraid of?
Could it be
Three simple words
Only the fear of being overheard
What's wrong?
Let it in on your secret heart
Secret Heart
Why so mysterious?
Why so secret?
Why so serious?
Could it be
Three simple words
Only the fear of being overheard
What's wrong?
Let it in on your secret heart"
